# Prefix regex

## Using `prefix` and `prefix_regex`

When the `prefix_regex` attribute is set to `true`, ambassador configures a [regex route](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.5.0/api-v1/route_config/route#route) instead of a prefix route in envoy. **This means the entire path must match the regex specified, not only the prefix.** 

## Example with version in url

If the version is a path parameter and the resources are served by different services, then

```yaml
---
apiVersion: ambassador/v1
kind:  Mapping
name:  qotm_mapping
prefix: "/(v1|v2)/qotm/.*"
prefix_regex: true
service: qotm
```

will map requests to both `/v1` and `/v2` to the `qotm` service.

Note that enclosing regular expressions in quotes can be important to prevent backslashes from being doubled.
