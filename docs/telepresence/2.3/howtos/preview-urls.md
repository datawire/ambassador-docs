# Share dev environments with preview URLs

Telepresence can generate sharable preview URLs, allowing you to work on a copy of your service locally and share that environment directly with a teammate for pair programming. While using preview URLs Telepresence will route only the requests coming from that preview URL to your local environment; requests to the ingress will be routed to your cluster as usual.

Preview URLs are protected behind authentication via Ambassador Cloud, ensuring that only users in your organization can view them. A preview URL can also be set to allow public access for sharing with outside collaborators.

## Prerequisites

* You should have the Telepresence CLI [installed](../../install/) on your laptop.

* If you have Telepresence already installed and have used it previously, please first reset it with `telepresence uninstall --everything`.

* You will need a service running in your cluster that you would like to intercept.

<Alert severity="info">
Need a sample app to try with preview URLs?  Check out the <a href="../../quick-start/demo-node/">quick start</a>. It has a multi-service app to install in your cluster with instructions to create a preview URL for that app.
</Alert>

## Creating a preview URL

1. List the services that you can intercept with `telepresence list` and make sure the one you want is listed.

    If it isn't:

    * Only Deployments, ReplicaSets, or StatefulSets are supported, and each of those requires a label matching a Service

    * If the service is in a different namespace, specify it with the `--namespace` flag

2. Log in to Ambassador Cloud where you can manage and share preview
   URLs:

   ```console
   $ telepresence login
   Launching browser authentication flow...
   <web browser opens, log in and choose your organization>
   Login successful.
   ```

   If you are in an environment where Telepresence cannot launch a
   local browser for you to interact with, you will need to pass the
   [`--apikey` flag to `telepresence
   login`](../../reference/client/login/).

3. Start the intercept:
`telepresence intercept <service-name> --port <TCP-port> --env-file <path-to-env-file>`

  For `--port`, specify the port on which your local instance of your service will be running. If the service you are intercepting exposes more than one port, specify the one you want to intercept after a colon.

  For `--env-file`, specify a file path where Telepresence will write the environment variables that are set in the Pod. This is going to be useful as we start our service locally.

   You will be asked for the following information:
   1. **Ingress layer 3 address**: This would usually be the internal address of your ingress controller in the format `<service name>.namespace `. For example, if you have a service `ambassador-edge-stack` in the `ambassador` namespace, you would enter `ambassador-edge-stack.ambassador`.
   2. **Ingress port**: The port on which your ingress controller is listening (often 80 for non-TLS and 443 for TLS).
   3. **Ingress TLS encryption**: Whether the ingress controller is expecting TLS communication on the specified port.
   4. **Ingress layer 5 hostname**: If your ingress controller routes traffic based on a domain name (often using the `Host` HTTP header), enter that value here.

   For the example below, you will create a preview URL for `example-service` which listens on port 8080.  The preview URL for ingress will use the `ambassador` service in the `ambassador` namespace on port `443` using TLS encryption and the hostname `dev-environment.edgestack.me`:

   ```
   $ telepresence intercept example-service --port 8080 --env-file ~/ex-svc.env

     To create a preview URL, telepresence needs to know how cluster
     ingress works for this service.  Please Confirm the ingress to use.

     1/4: What's your ingress' layer 3 (IP) address?
          You may use an IP address or a DNS name (this is usually a
          "service.namespace" DNS name).

            [default: -]: ambassador.ambassador

     2/4: What's your ingress' layer 4 address (TCP port number)?

            [default: -]: 443

     3/4: Does that TCP port on your ingress use TLS (as opposed to cleartext)?

            [default: n]: y

     4/4: If required by your ingress, specify a different layer 5 hostname
          (TLS-SNI, HTTP "Host" header) to access this service.

            [default: ambassador.ambassador]: dev-environment.edgestack.me

     Using deployment example-service
     intercepted
         Intercept name         : example-service
         State                  : ACTIVE
         Destination            : 127.0.0.1:8080
         Service Port Identifier: http
         Intercepting           : HTTP requests that match all of:
           header("x-telepresence-intercept-id") ~= regexp("<intercept-id>:example-service")
         Preview URL            : https://<random-domain-name>.preview.edgestack.me
         Layer 5 Hostname       : dev-environment.edgestack.me
   ```

4. Start your local environment using the environment variables retrieved in the previous step.

  Here are a few options to pass the environment variables to your local process:
   - with `docker run`, provide the path to the file using the [`--env-file` argument](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file)
   - with JetBrains IDE (IntelliJ, WebStorm, PyCharm, GoLand, etc.) use the [EnvFile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile)
   - with Visual Studio Code, specify the path to the environment variables file in the `envFile` field of your configuration

5. Go to the preview URL that was provided after starting the intercept (the next to last line in the terminal output above). Your local service will be processing the request.

  <Alert severity="success">
    <strong>Success!</strong> You have intercepted traffic coming from your preview URL without impacting other traffic from your Ingress.
  </Alert>

  <Alert severity="info">
    <strong>Didn't work?</strong> It might be because you have services in between your ingress controller and the service you are intercepting that do not propagate the <code>x-telepresence-intercept-id</code> HTTP Header. Read more on <a href="../../concepts/context-prop">context propagation</a>.
  </Alert>

6. Make a request on the URL you would usually query for that environment.  The request should **not** be routed to your laptop.

  Normal traffic coming into the cluster through the Ingress (i.e. not coming from the preview URL) will route to services in the cluster like normal.

7. Share with a teammate.

   You can collaborate with teammates by sending your preview URL to
   them. They will be asked to log in to Ambassador Cloud if they are
   not already.  Upon login they must select the same identity
   provider and org as you are using; that is how they are authorized
   to access the preview URL (see the [list of supported identity
   providers](../../faqs/#idps)). When they visit the preview URL,
   they will see the intercepted service running on your laptop.

<Alert severity="success">
  <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You have now created a dev environment and shared it with a teammate!  While you and your partner work together to debug your service, the production version remains unchanged to the rest of your team until you commit your changes.
</Alert>

## Sharing a preview URL with people outside your team

To collaborate with someone outside of your identity provider's organization, you must go to [Ambassador Cloud](https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/), navigate to your service's intercepts, select the preview URL details, and click **Make Publicly Accessible**.  Now anyone with the link will have access to the preview URL. When they visit the preview URL, they will see the intercepted service running on your laptop.

To disable sharing the preview URL publicly, click **Require Authentication** in the dashboard. Removing the preview URL either from the dashboard or by running `telepresence preview remove <intercept-name>` also removes all access to the preview URL.

## Change access restrictions

To collaborate with someone outside of your identity provider's organization, you must make your preview URL publicly accessible.

1. Go to [Ambassador Cloud](https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/)
2. Navigate to the desired service Intercepts page
3. Expand the preview URL details
4. Click **Make Publicly Accessible**

Now anyone with the link will have access to the preview URL. When they visit the preview URL, they will see the intercepted service running on a local environment.

To disable sharing the preview URL publicly, click **Require Authentication** in the dashboard.

## Remove a preview URL from an Intercept

To delete a preview URL and remove all access to the intercepted service,

1. Go to [Ambassador Cloud](https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/)
2. Navigate to the desired service Intercepts page
3. Expand the preview URL details
4. Click **Remove Preview**

Alternatively, a preview URL can also be removed by running
`telepresence preview remove <intercept-name>`
