# FAQ for v2.15

There are some big changes in Telepresence v2.15, read on to learn more about them.

** What are the main differences between v2.15 and v2.14?**

* In v2.15 we now require an Ambassador Cloud account to use most features of Telepresence. We offer [three plans](https://www.getambassador.io/editions) including a completely free tier.
* We have removed [Team Mode](../../2.14/concepts/modes#team-mode), and the default type of intercept is now a [Global Intercept](../concepts/intercepts), even when you are logged in.

** Why do I need an Ambassador Cloud account to use Telepresence now?**

The new pricing model for Telepresence accompanies the new requirement to create an account. Previously we only required an account for team features.
We’re now focused on making Telepresence an extremely capable tool for individual developers, from your first connect. We have added new capabilities to the product, which are listed in the question below comparing the two versions.
Because of that, we now require an account to use any Telepresence feature. Creating an account on Ambassador Cloud is completely free, takes a few seconds and can be done through accounts you already have, like GitHub and Google.

** What do I get from Telepresence that I can't get from the open-source version?**

We distribute up-to-date Telepresence binaries through Homebrew and a Windows installer; open-source binaries must be downloaded from the GitHub repository.
Our Lite plan offers the same capabilities as open-source but with that added convenience, and is completely free. The Lite plan also includes the Docker Extension.
Our Developer plan adds features like Personal Intercepts, Intercept Specs, Docker Compose integration, and 8x5 support to help you use Telepresence effectively.

We believe the Lite plan offers the best experience for hobbyists, the Developer plan for individual developers using Telepresence professionally, and the [open-source version](https://telepresence.io) for users who require for compliance, or prefer, a fully open-source solution.

** This feels like a push by Ambassador Labs to force people to the commercial version of Telepresence, what's up with that?**

One of the most common pieces of feedback we've received is how hard it’s been for users to tell what features of Telepresence were proprietary vs open-source, and which version they were using.
We've always made it more convenient to use the commercial version of Telepresence but we want to make it clearer now what the benefits are and when you're using it.

** What is the future of the open-source version Telepresence?**

Development on the open-source version remains active as it is the basis for the commercial version. We're regularly improving the client, the Traffic Manager, and other pieces of Telepresence open-source.
In addition, we recently started the process to move Telepresence in the CNCF from Sandbox status to Incubating status.

** Why are there limits on the Lite and Developer plans?**

The limits on the Developer plan exist to prevent abuse of individual licenses. We believe they are above what an individual developer would use in a given month, but reach out to support, included in your Developer plan, if they are causing an issue for you.
The limits on the Lite plan exist because it is a free plan.

** What if I'm in an air-gapped environment and can't login?"**

Air-gapped environments are supported in the [Enteprise edition](https://www.getambassador.io/editions) of Telepresence. Please [contact our sales team](https://www.getambassador.io/contact-us).
