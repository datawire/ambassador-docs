# Golden Paths

A golden path is a best practice or a standardized process you should apply to Telepresence, often used to optimize productivity or quality control. It can be used as a benchmark or a reference point for measuring success and progress towards a particular goal or outcome.

We have provided Golden Paths for multiple use cases listed below. 

1. [Intercept Specifications](../goldenpaths/specs)
2. [Using Telepresence with Docker](../goldenpaths/docker)
3. [Docker Compose](../goldenpaths/compose)
