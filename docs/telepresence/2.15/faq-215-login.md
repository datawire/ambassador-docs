# Telepresence v2.15 Account Requirement FAQ

There are some big changes in Telepresence 2.15, including the need for an Ambassador Cloud account. We address that change here and have a [more comprehensive FAQ](../faq-215) on the v2.15 release.

** Why do I need an Ambassador Cloud account to use Telepresence now?**

The new pricing model for Telepresence accompanies the new requirement to create an account. Previously we only required an account for team features.
We’re now focused on making Telepresence an extremely capable tool for individual developers, from your first connect. We have added new capabilities to the product, which are listed in the question below comparing the two versions.
Because of that, we now require an account to use any Telepresence feature. Creating an account on Ambassador Cloud is completely free, takes a few seconds and can be done through accounts you already have, like GitHub and Google.

** Can I get the old experience of connecting and doing global intercepts without an Ambassador Cloud account?**

Yes! The [open source version of Telepresence](https://telepresence.io) can do Connect and Global Intercepts and is independent of Ambassador Labs’ account infrastructure.
You can install the open-source binaries from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/releases).

** What do I get from Telepresence that I can't get from the open-source version?**

We distribute up-to-date Telepresence binaries through Homebrew and a Windows installer; open-source binaries must be downloaded from the GitHub repository.
Our Lite plan offers the same capabilities as open-source but with that added convenience, and is completely free. The Lite plan also includes the Docker Extension.
Our Developer plan adds features like Personal Intercepts, Intercept Specs, Docker Compose integration, and 8x5 support to help you use Telepresence effectively.

We believe the Lite plan offers the best experience for hobbyists, the Developer plan for individual developers using Telepresence professionally, and the open-source version for users who require for compliance, or prefer, a fully open-source solution.

** What if I'm in an air-gapped environment and can't login?"**

Air-gapped environments are supported in the [Enteprise edition](https://www.getambassador.io/editions) of Telepresence. Please [contact our sales team](https://www.getambassador.io/contact-us).
