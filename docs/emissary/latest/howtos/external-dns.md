# ExternalDNS with $productName$

[ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) configures your existing DNS provider to make Kubernetes resources discoverable via public DNS servers by getting resources from the Kubernetes API to create a list of DNS records.


## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Start by checking the [ExternalDNS repo's deployment instructions](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns#deploying-to-a-cluster) to get information about the supported DNS providers and steps to setup ExternalDNS for your provider. Each DNS provider will have its own required steps as well as annotations, arguments, and permissions needed for the following configuration.


### Installation

Configuration for a `ServiceAccount`, `ClusterRole`, and `ClusterRoleBinding` are necessary for the ExternalDNS deployment to support compatability with $productName$ and allow ExternalDNS to get hostnames from $productName$'s `Hosts`.

The following configuration is an example configuring $productName$ - ExternalDNS integration with [AWS Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) as the DNS provider. Refer to the ExternalDNS documentation above for annotations and arguments for your DNS Provider.


1. Create a YAML file named `externaldns-config.yaml`, and copy the following configuration into it.

  <Alert severity="info">
    Ensure that the <code>apiGroups</code> include <code>"getambassador.io"</code> following <code>"networking.k8s.io"</code> and the <code>resources</code> include <code>"hosts"</code> after <code>"ingresses"</code>.
  </Alert>

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: external-dns
      annotations:
        eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn: {ARN} # AWS ARN role
    ---
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: external-dns
    rules:
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["services","endpoints","pods"]
        verbs: ["get","watch","list"]
      - apiGroups: ["extensions","networking.k8s.io", "getambassador.io"]
        resources: ["ingresses", "hosts"]
        verbs: ["get","watch","list"]
      - apiGroups: [""]
        resources: ["nodes"]
        verbs: ["list","watch"]
    ---
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: external-dns-viewer
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: external-dns
    subjects:
      - kind: ServiceAccount
        name: external-dns
        namespace: default
    ---
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: external-dns
    spec:
      strategy:
        type: Recreate
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: external-dns
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: external-dns
          annotations:
            iam.amazonaws.com/role: {ARN} # AWS ARN role
        spec:
          serviceAccountName: external-dns
          containers:
          - name: external-dns
            image: registry.opensource.zalan.do/teapot/external-dns:latest
            args:
            - --source=ambassador-host
            - --domain-filter=example.net # will make ExternalDNS see only the hosted zones matching provided domain, omit to process all available hosted zones
            - --provider=aws
            - --policy=upsert-only # would prevent ExternalDNS from deleting any records, omit to enable full synchronization
            - --aws-zone-type=public # only look at public hosted zones (valid values are public, private or no value for both)
            - --registry=txt
            - --txt-owner-id= {Hosted Zone ID} # Insert Route53 Hosted Zone ID here
    ```

2. Review the arguments section from the ExternalDNS deployment

  Configure or remove arguments to fit your needs. Additional arguments required for your DNS provider can be found by checking the [ExternalDNS repo's deployment instructions](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns#deploying-to-a-cluster).

   * `--source=ambassador-host` - required across all DNS providers to tell ExternalDNS to look for hostnames in the $productName$ `Host` configurations.

3. Apply the above config with the following command to deploy ExternalDNS to your cluster and configure support for $productName$

  ```shell
  kubectl apply -f externaldns-ambassador.yaml
  ```

  <Alert severity="info">
    For the above example, ensure that you are using an EKS cluster, or <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/connect-any-kubernetes-cluster-to-amazon-eks/">register your cluster with AWS</a> so that ExternalDNS can view and edit your AWS Hosted Zones. If you are using a cluster outside EKS and not registered with AWS you will see permissions errors from the ExternalDNS pod when attempting to list the Hosted Zones.
  </Alert>

## Usage

After applying the above configuration, ExternalDNS is ready to use. Configure a `Host` with the following annotation to allow ExternalDNS to get the IP address of your $productName$'s LoadBalancer and register it with your DNS provider.

```yaml
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind: Host
metadata:
  name: your-hostname
  annotations:
    external-dns.ambassador-service: $productDeploymentName$.$productNamespace$
spec:
  acmeProvider:
    authority: none
  hostname: your-hostname.example.com
```


<Alert severity="success"><b>Victory!</b> ExternalDNS is now running and configured to report $productName$'s IP and hostname with your DNS provider.</Alert>
