# Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting system.  When used
along with Grafana, you can create a dynamic dashboard for monitoring
ingress into our Kubernetes cluster.

## Deployment

This guide will focus on deploying Prometheus and Grafana alongside
$productName$ in Kubernetes using the [Prometheus
Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator).

**Note:** Both Prometheus and Grafana can be deployed as standalone
applications outside of Kubernetes.  This process is well-documented
within the website and docs within their respective projects.

### $productName$

$productName$ makes it easy to output Envoy-generated
statistics to Prometheus.  For the remainder of this guide, it is
assumed that you have installed and configured $productName$
into your Kubernetes cluster, and that it is possible for you to
modify the global configuration of the $productName$
deployment.

The `/metrics` endpoint can be accessed internally via the $productName$ admin port (default 8877):

```
http(s)://ambassador:8877/metrics
```

or externally by creating a `Mapping` similar to below:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind: Mapping
metadata:
  name: metrics
spec:
  hostname: "*"
  prefix: /metrics
  rewrite: ""
  service: localhost:8877
```

**Note**: Since `/metrics` in an endpoint on $productName$
itself, the `service` field can just reference the admin port on
localhost.

### Using the `cluster_tag` setting

The metrics that Prometheus scrapes from $productName$ are keyed using
the name of the Envoy
[`cluster`](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/cluster_manager)
that is handling traffic for a given `Mapping`.  The name of a given
`cluster` is generated by $productName$ and, as such, is not necessarily
terribly readable.

You can set the `cluster_tag` attribute within a
[`Mapping`](../../topics/using/mappings) to specify a prefix for the
generated `cluster` name, to help manage metrics.

### Prometheus Operator with standard YAML

In this section, we will deploy the Prometheus Operator using the
standard YAML files.  Alternatively, you can install it with
[Helm](#prometheus-operator-with-helm) if you prefer.

1. Deploy the Prometheus Operator

   To deploy the Prometheus Operator, you can clone the repository and
   follow the instructions in the README, or simply create the resources
   published in the YAML with `kubectl`.

    ```
    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/prometheus-operator/master/bundle.yaml
    ```

2. Deploy Prometheus by creating a `Prometheus` CRD

    First, create RBAC resources for your Prometheus instance

    ```
    kubectl apply -f https://app.getambassador.io/yaml/v2-docs/$ossVersion$/monitoring/prometheus-rbac.yaml
    ```

    Then, copy the YAML below, and save it in a file called
    `prometheus.yaml`

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: prometheus
    spec:
      type: ClusterIP
      ports:
      - name: web
        port: 9090
        protocol: TCP
        targetPort: 9090
      selector:
        prometheus: prometheus
    ---
    apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
    kind: Prometheus
    metadata:
      name: prometheus
    spec:
      ruleSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: prometheus-operator
      serviceAccountName: prometheus
      serviceMonitorSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: ambassador
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: 400Mi
    ```

    ```
    kubectl apply -f prometheus.yaml
    ```

3. Create a `ServiceMonitor`

   Finally, we need to tell Prometheus where to scrape metrics
   from.  The Prometheus Operator easily manages this using a
   `ServiceMonitor` CRD.  To tell Prometheus to scrape metrics from
   $productName$'s `/metrics` endpoint, copy the following
   YAML to a file called `ambassador-monitor.yaml`, and apply it with
   `kubectl`.

    Scrape metrics directly from the `/metrics` endpoint of
    $productName$ running in the `ambassador` namespace:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
    kind: ServiceMonitor
    metadata:
      name: ambassador-monitor
      labels:
        app: ambassador
    spec:
      namespaceSelector:
        matchNames:
        - ambassador
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          service: ambassador-admin
      endpoints:
      - port: ambassador-admin
    ```

Prometheus is now configured to gather metrics from $productName$.

### Prometheus Operator with Helm

In this section, we will deploy the Prometheus Operator using
Helm.  Alternatively, you can install it with [kubectl
YAML](#prometheus-operator-with-standard-yaml) if you prefer.

The default [Helm
Chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts)
will install Prometheus and configure it to monitor your Kubernetes
cluster.

This section will focus on setting up Prometheus to scrape stats from
$productName$.  Configuration of the Helm Chart and analysis of
stats from other cluster components is outside of the scope of this
documentation.

1. Install the Prometheus Operator from the helm chart

    Following the most up-to-date instructions on the
    [kube-prometheus-stack official repository](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack),
    you should install the Prometheus Operator in a similar way:

    ```
    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo update
    helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
    ```

2. Create a `ServiceMonitor`

    The Prometheus Operator Helm chart creates a Prometheus instance
    that is looking for `ServiceMonitor`s with `label:
    release=prometheus`.

    Scrape metrics directly from the `/metrics` endpoint of
    $productName$ running in the `ambassador` namespace. You may
    want to adjust namespace and label selectors to match your installation:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
    kind: ServiceMonitor
    metadata:
      name: ambassador-monitor
      labels:
        release: prometheus
    spec:
      namespaceSelector:
        matchNames:
        - ambassador
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          service: ambassador-admin
      endpoints:
      - port: ambassador-admin
    ```

Prometheus is now configured to gather metrics from $productName$.

#### Prometheus Operator CRDs

The Prometheus Operator creates a series of Kubernetes Custom Resource
Definitions (CRDs) for managing Prometheus in Kubernetes.

| Custom Resource Definition | Description |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AlertManager` | An AlertManager handles alerts sent by the Prometheus server. |
| `PrometheusRule` | Registers altering and reporting rules with Prometheus.  |
| `Prometheus` | Creates a Prometheus instance.  |
| `ServiceMonitor` | Tells Prometheus where to scrape metrics from.  |

The prometheus-operator project published a full [API
reference](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md)
to these different CRDs.

### Grafana

Grafana is an open-source graphing tool for plotting data
points.  Grafana allows you to create dynamic dashboards for monitoring
your ingress traffic stats collected from Prometheus.

We have published a [sample
dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/4698) you can use
for monitoring your ingress traffic and control plane operations.

**Note:** If you deployed the Prometheus Operator via the Helm Chart,
a Grafana dashboard is created by default.  You can use this dashboard
or set `grafana.enabled: false` and follow the instructions below.

To deploy Grafana behind $productName$: replace
`{{AMBASSADOR_IP}}` with the IP address or DNS name of your $productName$ service, copy the YAML below, and apply it with `kubectl`:

**Note:** If you forgot how to get the value of your `AMBASSADOR_IP` or
have not set-up DNS, you can get the IP by using the `kubectl get services -n ambassador`
command, and select the External-IP of your $productName$ LoadBalancer service.

```yaml
---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: grafana
  labels:
    app: grafana
    component: core
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: grafana
      component: core
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: grafana
        component: core
      annotations:
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: 'false'
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: data
          emptyDir: {}
      containers:
        - name: grafana
          image: 'grafana/grafana:9.1.7'
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
              protocol: TCP
          env:
            - name: GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL
              value: {{ SCHEME }}://{{ AMBASSADOR_IP }}/grafana
            - name: GRAFANA_PORT
              value: '3000'
            - name: GF_AUTH_BASIC_ENABLED
              value: 'false'
            - name: GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ENABLED
              value: 'true'
            - name: GF_AUTH_ANONYMOUS_ORG_ROLE
              value: Admin
            - name: GF_PATHS_DATA
              value: /data/grafana
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 10m
          volumeMounts:
            - name: data
              mountPath: /data/grafana
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /api/health
              port: 3000
              scheme: HTTP
            timeoutSeconds: 1
            periodSeconds: 10
            successThreshold: 1
            failureThreshold: 3
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      restartPolicy: Always
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: grafana
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
  selector:
    app: grafana
    component: core
```

Now, create a service and `Mapping` to expose Grafana behind
$productName$:

**Note:** Don't forget to replace `{{GRAFANA_NAMESPACE}}` with the
namespace you deployed Grafana to. In our example we used the default namespace,
so for this example you would change it to `grafana.default` or just `grafana`.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind: Mapping
metadata:
  name: grafana
spec:
  hostname: "*"
  prefix: /grafana/
  service: grafana.{{GRAFANA_NAMESPACE}}
```

Now, access Grafana by going to `{AMBASSADOR_IP}/grafana/` and logging
in with `username: admin` : `password: admin`.

Before you can import the $productName$ dashboard. You need to add a data source.
From the Grafana home page, select `Add your first data source`. Now,
select 'Prometheus'. In the URL section, type in `http://prometheus.default:9090`,
or `http://prometheus-operated.default:9090` if you installed Prometheus with Helm.
We deployed prometheus to the default namespace in our example, but if you
deployed it to a different namespace, make sure to replace `default` with your
namespace. Press `Save & Test` to confirm that the data source works.

Import the [provided dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/4698)
by clicking `+ Import` while hovering the Dashboards menu in the left side-bar, and entering the dashboard ID `4698`.

From here, select the Prometheus data source we created from the `Prometheus` drop
down menu, and select import to finish adding the dashboard.

In the dashboard we just added, you should now be able to view graphs with
$productName$ metrics.


## Viewing stats/metrics

Above, you have created an environment where $productName$ is handling
ingress traffic, Prometheus is scraping and collecting statistics from
Envoy, and Grafana is displaying these statistics in a dashboard.

You can easily view a sample of these statistics via the Grafana
dashboard at `{AMBASSADOR_IP}/grafana/` and logging in with the
credentials above.

The example dashboard you installed above displays 'top line'
statistics about the API response codes, number of connections,
connection length, number of registered services, etc.

To view the full set of stats available to Prometheus you can access
the Prometheus UI by running:

```
kubectl port-forward service/prometheus 9090
```

and going to `http://localhost:9090/` from a web browser

In the UI, discover all the stats Prometheus is
able to scrape from $productName$ by searching for expressions
starting with `envoy` and `ambassador`.

The Prometheus data model is, at its core, time-series
based.  Therefore, it makes it easy to represent rates, averages,
peaks, minimums, and histograms.  Review the [Prometheus
documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/) for a
full reference on how to work with this data model.
