# Integration in community projects

import Table from "../../../../../src/components/CommunityTable";

**$AESproductName$ is now available and includes additional functionality beyond the current $OSSproductName$.**
These features include automatic HTTPS, OAuth/OpenID Connect authentication support, integrated rate
limiting, a developer portal, and [more](/edge-stack-faq/).

## $OSSproductName$ integrations

If you still want to use just $OSSproductName$, don't worry! $OSSproductName$
is currently available out-of-the-box in some Kubernetes installers and local environments.
