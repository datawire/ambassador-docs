# The $productName$ architecture

## $productName$ is a control plane

$productName$ is a specialized [control plane for Envoy Proxy](https://blog.getambassador.io/the-importance-of-control-planes-with-service-meshes-and-front-proxies-665f90c80b3d). In this architecture, $productName$ translates configuration (in the form of Kubernetes Custom Resources) to Envoy configuration. All actual traffic is directly handled by the high-performance [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io).

## Details

1. The service owner defines configuration in Kubernetes manifests.
2. When the manifest is applied to the cluster, the Kubernetes API notifies $productName$ of the change.
3. $productName$ parses the change and transforms the configuration into a semantic intermediate representation. Envoy configuration is generated from this IR.
4. The new configuration is passed to Envoy via the gRPC-based Aggregated Discovery Service (ADS) API.
5. Traffic flows through the reconfigured Envoy, without dropping any connections.

## Scaling and availability

$productName$ relies on Kubernetes for scaling, high availability, and persistence. All $productName$ configuration is stored directly in Kubernetes; there is no database. $productName$ is packaged as a single container that contains both the control plane and an Envoy Proxy instance. By default, $productName$ is deployed as a Kubernetes `deployment` and can be scaled and managed like any other Kubernetes deployment.

### Stateless architecture

By design, $productName$ is an entirely stateless architecture. Each individual $productName$ instance operates independently of other instances. These $productName$ instances rely on Kubernetes to coordinate the configuration between the different $productName$ instances. This enables $productName$ to sidestep the need to engineer a safe, highly available centralized control plane (and if you don't think that this is hard, check out [Jepsen](https://jepsen.io)). By contrast, other control plane architectures rely on a single centralized control plane to manage multiple instances of the data plane. This means that these control plane architectures must engineer resilience and availability into their central control plane.

## Envoy Proxy

$productName$ closely tracks Envoy Proxy releases. A stable branch of Envoy Proxy is maintained that enables the team to cherry-pick specific fixes into $productName$.
