# Deployment architecture

$productName$ can be deployed in a variety of configurations. The specific configuration depends on your data center.

## Public cloud

If you're using a public cloud provider such as Amazon, Azure, or Google, $productName$ can be deployed directly to a Kubernetes cluster running in the data center. Traffic is routed to $productName$ via a cloud-managed load balancer such as an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer or Google Cloud Load Balancer. Typically, this load balancer is transparently managed by Kubernetes in the form of the `LoadBalancer` service type. $productName$ then routes traffic to your services running in Kubernetes.

## On-Premise data center

In an on-premise data center, $productName$ is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster. Instead of exposing it via the `LoadBalancer` service type, $productName$ is exposed as a `NodePort`. Traffic is sent to a specific port on any of the nodes in the cluster, which route the traffic to $productName$, which then routes the traffic to your services running in Kubernetes. You'll also need to deploy a separate load balancer to route traffic from your core routers to $productName$. [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) is an open-source external load balancer for Kubernetes designed for this problem. Other options are traditional TCP load balancers such as F5 or Citrix Netscaler.

## Hybrid data center

Many data centers include services that are running outside of Kubernetes on virtual machines. For $productName$ to route to services both inside and outside of Kubernetes, it needs the real-time network location of all services. This problem is known as "[service discovery](https://www.datawire.io/guide/traffic/service-discovery-microservices/)" and $productName$ supports using [Consul](https://www.consul.io). Services in your data center register themselves with Consul, and $productName$ uses Consul-supplied data to dynamically route requests to available services.

## Hybrid on-premise data center

The diagram below details a common network architecture for a hybrid on-premise data center. Traffic flows from core routers to MetalLB, which routes to $productName$ running in Kubernetes. $productName$ routes traffic to individual services running on both Kubernetes and VMs. Consul tracks the real-time network location of the services, which $productName$ uses to route to the given services.
