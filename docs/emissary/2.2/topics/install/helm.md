# Install with Helm

<Alert severity="warning">

  To migrate from $productName$ 1.X to $productName$ 2.X, see the
  [$productName$ migration matrix](../migration-matrix/). This guide
  **will not work** for that, due to changes to the configuration
  resources used for $productName$ 2.X.

</Alert>

[Helm](https://helm.sh) is a package manager for Kubernetes that automates the release and management of software on Kubernetes. $productName$ can be installed via a Helm chart with a few simple steps, depending on if you are deploying for the first time, upgrading $productName$ from an existing installation, or migrating from $productName$.

## Before you begin

The $productName$ Helm chart is hosted by Datawire and published at `https://app.getambassador.io`.

Start by adding this repo to your helm client with the following command:

```
helm repo add datawire https://app.getambassador.io
helm repo update
```

## Install with Helm

When you run the Helm chart, it installs $productName$.

1. Install the $productName$ CRDs.

   Before installing $productName$ $version$ itself, you must configure your
   Kubernetes cluster to support the `getambassador.io/v3alpha1` and `getambassador.io/v2`
   configuration resources. This is required.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://app.getambassador.io/yaml/emissary/$version$/emissary-crds.yaml
   kubectl wait --timeout=90s --for=condition=available deployment emissary-apiext -n emissary-system
   ```

   <Alert severity="info">
     $productName$ $version$ includes a Deployment in the `emissary-system` namespace
     called <code>$productDeploymentName$-apiext</code>. This is the APIserver extension
     that supports converting $productName$ CRDs between <code>getambassador.io/v2</code>
     and <code>getambassador.io/v3alpha1</code>. This Deployment needs to be running at
     all times.
   </Alert>

   <Alert severity="warning">
     If the <code>$productDeploymentName$-apiext</code> Deployment's Pods all stop running,
     you will not be able to use <code>getambassador.io/v3alpha1</code> CRDs until restarting
     the <code>$productDeploymentName$-apiext</code> Deployment.
   </Alert>

2. Install the $productName$ Chart with the following command:

    ```
	 helm install -n $productNamespace$ --create-namespace \
		 $productHelmName$ datawire/$productHelmName$ && \
	 kubectl rollout status  -n $productNamespace$ deployment/$productDeploymentName$ -w
    ```

3. Next Steps

   $productName$ shold now be successfully installed and running, but in order to get started deploying Services and test routing to them you need to configure a few more resources.

   - [The `Listener` Resource](../../running/listener/) is required to configure which ports the $productName$ pods listen on so that they can begin responding to requests.
   - [The `Mapping` Resouce](../../using/intro-mappings/) is used to configure routing requests to services in your cluster.
   - [The `Host` Resource](../../running/host-crd/) configures TLS termination for enabling HTTPS communication.
   - Explore how $productName$ [configures communication with clients](../../../howtos/configure-communications)

  <Alert severity="info">
     We strongly recommend following along with our <a href="../../../tutorials/getting-started">Quickstart Guide</a> to get started by creating a <code>Listener</code>, deploying a simple service to test with, and setting up a <code>Mapping</code> to route requests from $productName$ to the demo service.
