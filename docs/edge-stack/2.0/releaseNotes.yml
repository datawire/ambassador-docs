      - title: Developer Preview!
        body: We're pleased to introduce $productName$ 2.0.1 as a <b>developer preview</b>. The 2.X family introduces a number of changes to allow $productName$ to more gracefully handle larger installations, reduce global configuration to better handle multitenant or multiorganizational installations, reduce memory footprint, and improve performance. We welcome feedback!! Join us on <a href="https://a8r.io/slack">Slack</a> and let us know what you think.

      - title: Improved Ambassador Cloud visibility
        type: feature
        body: Ambassador Agent reports sidecar process information and Mapping OpenAPI documentation to Ambassador Cloud to provide more visibility into services and clusters.
        docs: ../../cloud/latest/service-catalog/quick-start/

      - title: Configurable per-AmbassadorListener statistics prefix
        body: The optional <code>stats_prefix</code> element of the <code>AmbassadorListener</code> CRD now determines the prefix of HTTP statistics emitted for a specific <code>AmbassadorListener</code>.
        type: feature
        docs: topics/running/ambassadorlistener

      - title: Configurable statistics names
        body: The optional <code>stats_name</code> element of <code>AmbassadorMapping</code>, <code>AmbassadorTCPMapping</code>, <code>AuthService</code>, <code>LogService</code>, <code>RateLimitService</code>, and <code>TracingService</code> now sets the name under which cluster statistics will be logged. The default is the <code>service</code>, with non-alphanumeric characters replaced by underscores.
        type: feature
        docs: topics/running/statistics

      - title: Configurable Dev Portal fetch timeout
        type: bugfix
        body: The <code>AmbassadorMapping</code> resource can now specify <code>docs.timeout_ms</code> to set the timeout when the Dev Portal is fetching API specifications.
        docs: topics/using/dev-portal/

      - title: Dev Portal search strips HTML tags
        type: bugfix
        body: The Dev Portal will now strip HTML tags when displaying search results, showing just the actual content of the search result.
        docs: topics/using/dev-portal/

      - title: Updated klog to reduce log noise
        type: bugfix
        body: We have updated to <code>k8s.io/klog/v2</code> to track upstream and to quiet unnecessary log output.
        docs: https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/issues/3603

      - title: Subsecond time resolution in logs
        type: change
        body: Logs now include subsecond time resolutions, rather than just seconds.
        docs: https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/pull/3650

      - title: Envoy-configuration snapshots saved
        type: change
        body: Envoy-configuration snapshots get saved (as <code>ambex-#.json</code>) in <code>/ambassador/snapshots</code>. The number of snapshots is controlled by the <code>AMBASSADOR_AMBEX_SNAPSHOT_COUNT</code> environment variable; set it to 0 to disable. The default is 30.
        docs: topics/running/running/

      - title: Configurable Envoy-configuration rate limiting
        type: change
        body: Set <code>AMBASSADOR_AMBEX_NO_RATELIMIT</code> to <code>true</code> to completely disable ratelimiting Envoy reconfiguration under memory pressure. This can help performance with the endpoint or Consul resolvers, but could make OOMkills more likely with large configurations. The default is <code>false</code>, meaning that the rate limiter is active.
        docs: topics/concepts/rate-limiting-at-the-edge/

      - title: Improved Consul certificate rotation visibility
        type: change
        body: Consul certificate-rotation logging now includes the fingerprints and validity timestamps of certificates being rotated.

      - title: The AmbassadorListener Resource
        body: The new <code>AmbassadorListener</code> CRD defines where and how to listen for requests from the network, and which <code>AmbassadorHost</code> definitions should be used to process those requests. Note that the <code>AmbassadorListener</code> CRD is <b>mandatory</b> and consolidates <i>all</i> port configuration; see the <a href="topics/running/ambassadorlistener"><code>AmbassadorListener</code> documentation</a> for more details.
        type: feature
        docs: topics/running/ambassadorlistener
        image: ./edge-stack-2.0.0-listener.png

      - title: Port configuration outside AmbassadorListener has been moved to AmbassadorListener
        body: The <code>TLSContext</code> <code>redirect_cleartext_from</code> and <code>AmbassadorHost</code> <code>requestPolicy.insecure.additionalPort</code> elements are no longer supported. Use a <code>AmbassadorListener</code> for this functionality instead.
        type: change
        docs: about/changes-2.0.0/#tlscontext-redirect_cleartext_from-and-host-insecureadditionalport

      - title: PROXY protocol configuration has been moved to AmbassadorListener
        body: The <code>use_proxy_protocol</code> element of the Ambassador <code>Module</code> is no longer supported, as it is now part of the <code>AmbassadorListener</code> resource (and can be set per-<code>AmbassadorListener</code> rather than globally).
        type: change
        docs: about/changes-2.0.0/#proxy-protocol-configuration

      - title: Independent Host actions supported
        body: Each <code>AmbassadorHost</code> can specify its <code>requestPolicy.insecure.action</code> independently of any other <code>AmbassadorHost</code>, allowing for HTTP routing as flexible as HTTPS routing.

        type: bugfix

      - title: Stricter rules for AmbassadorHost/AmbassadorMapping association
        body: A <code>AmbassadorMapping</code> will only be matched with a <code>AmbassadorHost</code> if the <code>AmbassadorMapping</code>'s <code>host</code> or the <code>AmbassadorHost</code>'s <code>selector</code> (or both) are explicitly set, and match. This change can significantly improve $productName$'s memory footprint when many <code>AmbassadorHost</code>s are involved. Further details are available in the <a href="about/changes-2.0.0/#host-and-mapping-association">2.0.0 Changes</a> document.
        docs: about/changes-2.0.0/#host-and-mapping-association
        type: change

      - title: AmbassadorHost or Ingress now required for TLS termination
        body: A <code>AmbassadorHost</code> or <code>Ingress</code> resource is now required when terminating TLS -- simply creating a <code>TLSContext</code> is not sufficient. Further details are available in the <a href="about/changes-2.0.0/#host-tlscontext-and-tls-termination"><code>AmbassadorHost</code> CRD documentation.</a>

      - title: Envoy V3 APIs
        body: By default, $productName$ will configure Envoy using the V3 Envoy API. This change is mostly transparent to users, but note that Envoy V3 does not support unsafe regular expressions or, e.g., Zipkin's V1 collector protocol. Further details are available in the <a href="about/changes-2.0.0">2.0.0 Changes</a> document.

        docs: about/changes-2.0.0/#envoy-v3-api-by-default

      - title: Correctly set Ingress resource status in all cases
        body: $productName$ 2.0.0 fixes a regression in detecting the Ambassador Kubernetes service that could cause the wrong IP or hostname to be used in Ingress statuses -- thanks, <a href="https://github.com/impl">Noah Fontes</a>!
        docs: topics/running/ingress-controller
        type: bugfix
        image: ./edge-stack-2.0.0-ingressstatus.png

      - title: Stricter mTLS enforcement
        body: $productName$ 2.0.0 fixes a bug where mTLS could use the wrong configuration when SNI and the <code>:authority</code> header didn't match
        type: bugfix

      - title: Module-based TLS no longer supported
        body: The <code>tls</code> module and the <code>tls</code> field in the Ambassador module are no longer supported. Please use <code>TLSContext</code> resources instead.

        type: change

      - title: Memory usage improvements for installations with many AmbassadorHosts
        body: The behavior of the Ambassador module <code>prune_unreachable_routes</code> field is now automatic, which should reduce Envoy memory requirements for installations with many <code>AmbassadorHost</code>s

  - version: 1.13.7
    date: '2021-06-03'
    notes:
      - title: JSON logging support
        body: "An <code>AMBASSADOR_JSON_LOGGING</code> environment variable has been added. When set to <code>true</code> JSON format will be used for most of the control plane logs. Some (but few) logs from <code>gunicorn</code> and the Kubernetes <code>client-go</code> package will still be in text only format."

      - title: Consul resolver bugfix with TCPMappings
        body: "The TCPMapping has the ability to specify a resolver, however the <code>ConsulResolver</code> did not work properly with it. It now utilizes the Consul Connect service discovery instead of falling back to attempting to register an arbitrary endpoint."

        type: bugfix
      - title: Memory usage calculation improvements
        body: "The internal memory usage calculation that $productName$ performs has been updated to exclude cache memory. This now matches how the kernel OOMKiller calculates memory and should avoid situations where Envoy updates are throttled unnecessarily."
