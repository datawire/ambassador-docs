        type: feature
        body: Ambassador Agent reports sidecar process information and Mapping OpenAPI documentation to Ambassador Cloud to provide more visibility into services and clusters.
        docs: ../../cloud/latest/service-catalog/quick-start/

      - title: Configurable per-AmbassadorListener statistics prefix
        body: The optional <code>stats_prefix</code> element of the <code>AmbassadorListener</code> CRD now determines the prefix of HTTP statistics emitted for a specific <code>AmbassadorListener</code>.

The default is the <code>service</code>, with non-alphanumeric characters replaced by underscores.

        docs: topics/running/statistics

      - title: Configurable Dev Portal fetch timeout
        type: bugfix
        body: The <code>AmbassadorMapping</code> resource can now specify <code>docs.timeout_ms</code> to set the timeout when the Dev Portal is fetching API specifications.
        docs: topics/using/dev-portal/

      - title: The AmbassadorListener Resource
        body: The new <code>AmbassadorListener</code> CRD defines where and how to listen for requests from the network, and which <code>AmbassadorHost</code> definitions should be used to process those requests. Note that the <code>AmbassadorListener</code> CRD is <b>mandatory</b> and consolidates <i>all</i> port configuration; see the <a href="topics/running/ambassadorlistener"><code>AmbassadorListener</code> documentation</a> for more details.

      - title: Port configuration outside AmbassadorListener has been moved to AmbassadorListener
        body: The <code>TLSContext</code> <code>redirect_cleartext_from</code> and <code>AmbassadorHost</code> <code>requestPolicy.insecure.additionalPort</code> elements are no longer supported. Use a <code>AmbassadorListener</code> for this functionality instead.

        docs: about/changes-2.0.0/#tlscontext-redirect_cleartext_from-and-host-insecureadditionalport

      - title: PROXY protocol configuration has been moved to AmbassadorListener
        body: The <code>use_proxy_protocol</code> element of the Ambassador <code>Module</code> is no longer supported, as it is now part of the <code>AmbassadorListener</code> resource (and can be set per-<code>AmbassadorListener</code> rather than globally).
        type: change
        docs: about/changes-2.0.0/#proxy-protocol-configuration

      - title: Independent Host actions supported

      - title: Stricter rules for AmbassadorHost/AmbassadorMapping association
        body: A <code>AmbassadorMapping</code> will only be matched with a <code>AmbassadorHost</code> if the <code>AmbassadorMapping</code>'s <code>host</code> or the <code>AmbassadorHost</code>'s <code>selector</code> (or both) are explicitly set, and match. This change can significantly improve $productName$'s memory footprint when many <code>AmbassadorHost</code>s are involved. Further details are available in the <a href="about/changes-2.0.0/#host-and-mapping-association">2.0.0 Changes</a> document.

        type: change

      - title: AmbassadorHost or Ingress now required for TLS termination
        body: A <code>AmbassadorHost</code> or <code>Ingress</code> resource is now required when terminating TLS -- simply creating a <code>TLSContext</code> is not sufficient.

      - title: Memory usage improvements for installations with many AmbassadorHosts
