## 1. Installation

### Getting a license from Ambassador Cloud

We'll start by installing $productName$ into your cluster.

$productName$ requires a [license](../../topics/using/licenses) to function, so the first step is getting one to use while installing. If you are in air-gapped environment, please [contact sales](https://www.getambassador.io/contact-us).

1. Log in to [Ambassador Cloud](https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/edge-stack/license/existing/) with GitHub, GitLab or Google and select your team account.

2. Follow the prompts to name the cluster and click **Generate Key**.

3. Either follow the installation instructions there, or copy the token out and follow along here.

4. Once your cluster is connected to Ambassador Cloud, a community license is automatically applied.

**We recommend using Helm** to install but there are other options below to choose from.

<Alert severity="success"><b>Success!</b> At this point, you have installed $productName$. Now let's get some traffic flowing to your services.</Alert>

## 2. Routing traffic from the edge

$productName$ uses Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to declaratively define its desired state. The workflow you are going to build uses a simple demo app, a **`Listener` CRD**, and a **`Mapping` CRD**. The `Listener` CRD tells $productName$ what port to listen on, and the `Mapping` CRD tells $productName$ how to route incoming requests by host and URL path from the edge of your cluster to Kubernetes services.

1. Start by creating a `Listener` resource for HTTP on port 8080:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    ---
    apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
    kind: Listener
    metadata:
      name: $productDeploymentName$-listener-8080
      namespace: $productNamespace$
    spec:
      port: 8080
      protocol: HTTP
      securityModel: XFP
      hostBinding:
        namespace:
          from: ALL
    ---
    apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
    kind: Listener
    metadata:
      name: $productDeploymentName$-listener-8443
      namespace: $productNamespace$
    spec:
      port: 8443
      protocol: HTTPS
      securityModel: XFP
      hostBinding:
        namespace:
          from: ALL
    EOF
    ```

2. Apply the YAML for the "Quote" service.

  ```
  kubectl apply -f https://app.getambassador.io/yaml/v2-docs/$ossVersion$/quickstart/qotm.yaml
  ```

  <Alert severity="info">The Service and Deployment are created in your default namespace. You can use <code>kubectl get services,deployments quote</code> to see their status.</Alert>

3. Generate the YAML for a `Mapping` to tell $productName$ to route all traffic inbound to the `/backend/` path to the `quote` Service.

  In this step, we'll be using the Mapping Editor, which you can find in the service details view of your [Ambassador Cloud connected installation](#getting-a-license-from-ambassador-cloud).
  Open your browser to https://app.getambassador.io/cloud/services/quote/details and click on **New Mapping**.

  Default options are automatically populated. **Enable and configure the following settings**, then click **Generate Mapping**:
    - **Path Matching**: `/backend/`
    - **OpenAPI Docs**: `/.ambassador-internal/openapi-docs`

    ![](../images/mapping-editor.png)

  Whether you decide to automatically push the change to Git for this newly create Mapping resource or not, the resulting Mapping should be similar to the example below.

  **Apply this YAML to your target cluster now.**

  ```yaml
  kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
  ---
  apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
  kind: Mapping
  metadata:
    name: quote-backend
  spec:
    hostname: "*"
    prefix: /backend/
    service: quote
    docs:
      path: "/.ambassador-internal/openapi-docs"
  EOF
  ```

4. Store the $productName$ load balancer IP address to a local environment variable. You will use this variable to test access to your service.

  ```
  export LB_ENDPOINT=$(kubectl -n $productNamespace$ get svc  $productDeploymentName$ \
    -o "go-template={{range .status.loadBalancer.ingress}}{{or .ip .hostname}}{{end}}")
  ```

5. Test the configuration by accessing the service through the $productName$ load balancer:

  ```
  $ curl -Lki https://$LB_ENDPOINT/backend/

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    content-type: application/json
    date: Wed, 23 Jun 2021 16:49:46 GMT
    content-length: 163
    x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 0
    server: envoy

    {
        "server": "serene-grapefruit-gjd4yodo",
        "quote": "The last sentence you read is often sensible nonsense.",
        "time": "2021-06-23T16:49:46.613322198Z"
    }
  ```

<Alert severity="success"><b>Victory!</b> You have created your first $productName$ Mapping, routing a request from your cluster's edge to a service!</Alert>

Explore some of the popular tutorials on $productName$:

* [Intro to Mappings](../../topics/using/intro-mappings/): declaratively routes traffic from
the edge of your cluster to a Kubernetes service
* [Host resource](../../topics/running/host-crd/): configure a hostname and TLS options for your ingress.
* [Rate Limiting](../../topics/using/rate-limits/rate-limits/): create policies to control sustained traffic loads

$productName$ has a comprehensive range of [features](/features/) to
support the requirements of any edge microservice.
