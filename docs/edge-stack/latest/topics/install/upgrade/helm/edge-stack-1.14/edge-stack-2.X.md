# Upgrade $productName$ 1.14.X to $productName$ $versionTwoX$ (Helm)

<Alert severity="info">
  This guide covers migrating from $productName$ 1.14.X to $productName$ $versionTwoX$. If
  this is not your <b>exact</b> situation, see the <a href="../../../../migration-matrix">migration
  matrix</a>.
</Alert>

<Alert severity="warning">
  This guide is written for upgrading an installation originally made using Helm.
  If you did not install with Helm, see the <a href="../../../yaml/edge-stack-1.14/edge-stack-2.X">YAML-based
  upgrade instructions</a>.
</Alert>

We're pleased to introduce $productName$ $versionTwoX$! The 2.X family introduces a number of
changes to allow $productName$ to more gracefully handle larger installations (including
multitenant or multiorganizational installations), reduce memory footprint, and improve
performance. In keeping with [SemVer](https://semver.org), $productName$ 2.X introduces
some changes that aren't backward-compatible with 1.X. These changes are detailed in
[Major Changes in $productName$ 2.X](../../../../../../about/changes-2.x).

## Migration Overview

<Alert severity="warning">
  <b>Read the migration instructions below</b> before making any changes to your
  cluster!
</Alert>

The recommended strategy for migration is to run $productName$ 1.14 and $productName$
$versionTwoX$ side-by-side in the same cluster. This gives $productName$ $versionTwoX$
and $productName$ 1.14 access to all the same configuration resources, with some
important caveats:

1. **$productName$ 1.14 will not see any `getambassador.io/v3alpha1` resources.**

   This is intentional; it provides a way to apply configuration only to
   $productName$ $versionTwoX$, while not interfering with the operation of your
   $productName$ 1.14 installation.

2. **If needed, you can use labels to further isolate configurations.**

   If you need to prevent your $productName$ $versionTwoX$ installation from
   seeing a particular bit of $productName$ 1.14 configuration, you can apply
   a Kubernetes label to the configuration resources that should be seen by
   your $productName$ $versionTwoX$ installation, then set its
   `AMBASSADOR_LABEL_SELECTOR` environment variable to restrict its configuration
   to only the labelled resources.

   For example, you could apply a `version-two: true` label to all resources
   that should be visible to $productName$ $versionTwoX$, then set
   `AMBASSADOR_LABEL_SELECTOR=version-two=true` in its Deployment.

3. **$productName$ 1.14 must remain in control of ACME while both installations are running.**

   The processes that handle ACME challenges cannot be managed by both $productName$
   1.X and $productName$ $versionTwoX$ at the same time. The instructions below disable ACME
   in $productName$ $versionTwoX$, allowing $productName$ 1.14 to continue managing it.

   This implies that any new `Host`s used for $productName$ 1.14 should be created using
   `getambassador.io/v2` so that $productName$ 1.14 can see them.

4. **Check `AuthService` and `RateLimitService` resources, if any.**

   If you have an [`AuthService`](../../../../../using/authservice/) or
   [`RateLimitService`](../../../../../running/services/rate-limit-service) installed, make
   sure that they are using the [namespace-qualified DNS name](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#namespaces-of-services).
   If they are not, the initial migration tests may fail.

   Additionally, when installing with Helm, you must make sure that $productName$ $versionTwoX$
   does not attempt to create duplicate `AuthService` and `RateLimitService` entries. Add

   ```
   --set rateLimit.create=false
   ```

   and

   ```
   --set authService.create=false
   ```

   on the Helm command line to prevent duplicating these resources.

5. **Be careful to only have one $productName$ Agent running at a time.**

   The $productName$ Agent is responsible for communications between
   $productName$ and Ambassador Cloud. If multiple versions of the Agent are
   running simultaneously, Ambassador Cloud could see conflicting information
   about your cluster.

   The best way to avoid multiple agents when installing with Helm is to use
   `--set emissary-ingress.agent.enabled=false` to tell Helm not to install a
   new Agent with $productName$ $versionTwoX$. Once testing is done, you can switch
   Agents safely.

6. **If you use ACME for multiple `Host`s, add a wildcard `Host` too.**

   This is required to manage a known issue. This issue will be resolved in a future
   $AESproductName$ release.

7. **Be careful about label selectors on Kubernetes Services!**

   If you have services in $productName$ 1.14 that use selectors that will match
   Pods from $productName$ $versionTwoX$, traffic will be erroneously split between
   $productName$ 1.14 and $productName$ $versionTwoX$. The labels used by $productName$
   $versionTwoX$ include:

   ```yaml
   app.kubernetes.io/name: edge-stack
   app.kubernetes.io/instance: edge-stack
   app.kubernetes.io/part-of: edge-stack
   app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: getambassador.io
   product: aes
   profile: main
   ```

You can also migrate by [installing $productName$ $versionTwoX$ in a separate cluster](../../../../migrate-to-2-alternate).
This permits absolute certainty that your $productName$ 1.14 configuration will not be
affected by changes meant for $productName$ $versionTwoX$, and it eliminates concerns about
ACME, but it is more effort.

## Side-by-Side Migration Steps

Migration is an eight-step process:

1. **Make sure that older configuration resources are not present.**

   $productName$ 2.X does not support `getambassador.io/v0` or `getambassador.io/v1`
   resources, and Kubernetes will not permit removing support for CRD versions that are
   still in use for stored resources. To verify that no resources older than
   `getambassador.io/v2` are active, run

   ```
   kubectl get crds -o 'go-template={{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}={{.status.storedVersions}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}' | fgrep getambassador.io
   ```

   If `v1` is present in the output, **do not begin migration.** The old resources must be
   converted to `getambassador.io/v2` and the `storedVersion` information in the cluster
   must be updated. If necessary, contact Ambassador Labs on [Slack](http://a8r.io/slack)
   for more information.

2. **Install new CRDs.**

   Before installing $productName$ $versionTwoX$ itself, you must configure your
   Kubernetes cluster to support its new `getambassador.io/v3alpha1` configuration
   resources. Note that `getambassador.io/v2` resources are still supported, but **you
   must install support for `getambassador.io/v3alpha1`** to run $productName$ $versionTwoX$,
   even if you intend to continue using only `getambassador.io/v2` resources for some
   time.

   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://app.getambassador.io/yaml/edge-stack/$versionTwoX$/aes-crds.yaml && \
   kubectl wait --timeout=90s --for=condition=available deployment emissary-apiext -n emissary-system
   ```

   <Alert severity="info">
     $productName$ $versionTwoX$ includes a Deployment in the `emissary-system` namespace
     called <code>emissary-apiext</code>. This is the APIserver extension
     that supports converting $productName$ CRDs between <code>getambassador.io/v2</code>
     and <code>getambassador.io/v3alpha1</code>. This Deployment needs to be running at
     all times.
   </Alert>

   <Alert severity="warning">
     If the <code>emissary-apiext</code> Deployment's Pods all stop running,
     you will not be able to use <code>getambassador.io/v3alpha1</code> CRDs until restarting
     the <code>emissary-apiext</code> Deployment.
   </Alert>

   <Alert severity="warning">
    There is a known issue with the <code>emissary-apiext</code> service that impacts all $productName$ 2.x and 3.x users. Specifically, the TLS certificate used by apiext expires one year after creation and does not auto-renew. All users who are running $productName$/$OSSproductName$ 2.x or 3.x with the apiext service should proactively renew their certificate as soon as practical by running <code>kubectl delete --all secrets --namespace=emissary-system</code> to delete the existing certificate, and then restart the <code>emissary-apiext</code> deployment with <code>kubectl rollout restart deploy/emissary-apiext -n emissary-system</code>.
    This will create a new certificate with a one year expiration. We will issue a software patch to address this issue well before the one year expiration. Note that certificate renewal will not cause any downtime.
   </Alert>

3. **Install $productName$ $versionTwoX$.**

   After installing the new CRDs, you need to install $productName$ $versionTwoX$ itself
   **in the same namespace as your existing $productName$ 1.14 installation**. It's important
   to use the same namespace so that the two installations can see the same secrets, etc.

   <Alert severity="warning">
     <b>Make sure that you set the <code>AES_ACME_LEADER_DISABLE</code> flag.</b> This prevents
     $productName$ $versionTwoX$ from trying to manage ACME, so that $productName$ 1.14 can
     do it instead.
   </Alert>

   Start by making sure that your `datawire` Helm repo is set correctly:

   ```bash
   helm repo remove datawire
   helm repo add datawire https://app.getambassador.io
   helm repo update
   ```

   Typically, $productName$ 1.14 was installed in the `ambassador` namespace. If you installed
   $productName$ 1.14 in a different namespace, change the namespace in the commands below.

   - If you do not need to set `AMBASSADOR_LABEL_SELECTOR`:

      ```bash
      helm install -n ambassador \
           --set emissary-ingress.agent.enabled=false \
           --set rateLimit.create=false \
           --set authService.create=false \
           --set emissary-ingress.env.AES_ACME_LEADER_DISABLE=true \
           edge-stack datawire/edge-stack && \
      kubectl rollout status  -n ambassador deployment/edge-stack -w
      ```

   - If you do need to set `AMBASSADOR_LABEL_SELECTOR`, use `--set`, for example:

      ```bash
      helm install -n ambassador \
           --set emissary-ingress.agent.enabled=false \
           --set rateLimit.create=false \
           --set authService.create=false \
           --set emissary-ingress.env.AES_ACME_LEADER_DISABLE=true \
           --set emissary-ingress.env.AMBASSADOR_LABEL_SELECTOR="version-two=true" \
           edge-stack datawire/edge-stack && \
      kubectl rollout status -n ambassador deployment/edge-stack -w
      ```

   <Alert severity="warning">
    You must use the <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/datawire/edge-stack/$aesChartVersion$"><code>$productHelmName$</code> Helm chart</a> for $productName$ $versionTwoX$.
    Do not use the <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/datawire/ambassador/6.9.3"><code>ambassador</code> Helm chart</a>.
   </Alert>

4. **Install `Listener`s and `Host`s as needed.**

   An important difference between $productName$ 1.14 and $productName$ $versionTwoX$ is the
   new **mandatory** `Listener` CRD. Also, when running both installations side by side,
   you will need to make sure that a `Host` is present for the new $productName$ $versionTwoX$
   Service. For example:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   ---
   apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
   kind: Listener
   metadata:
     name: ambassador-http-listener
   spec:
     port: 8080
     protocol: HTTPS
     securityModel: XFP
     hostBinding:
       namespace:
         from: ALL
   ---
   apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
   kind: Listener
   metadata:
     name: ambassador-https-listener
   spec:
     port: 8443
     protocol: HTTPS
     securityModel: XFP
     hostBinding:
       namespace:
         from: ALL
   ---
   apiVersion: getambassador.io/v2
   kind: Host
   metadata:
     name: emissary-host
   spec:
     hostname: $EMISSARY_HOSTNAME
     tlsSecret:
       name: $EMISSARY_TLS_SECRET
   EOF
   ```

   <Alert severity="warning">
     <b>Make sure that any <code>Host</code>s you create use API version <code>getambassador.io/v2</code></b>,
     so that they can be managed by $productName$ 1.14 as long as both installations are running.
   </Alert>

   This example requires that you know the hostname for the $productName$ Service (`$EMISSARY_HOSTNAME`)
   and that you have created a TLS Secret for it in `$EMISSARY_TLS_SECRET`.

5. **Test!**

   Your $productName$ $versionTwoX$ installation can support the `getambassador.io/v2`
   configuration resources used by $productName$ 1.14, but you may need to make some
   changes to the configuration, as detailed in the documentation on
   [configuring $productName$ Communications](../../../../../../howtos/configure-communications)
   and [updating CRDs to `getambassador.io/v3alpha1`](../../../../convert-to-v3alpha1).

   <Alert severity="info">
     Kubernetes will not allow you to have a <code>getambassador.io/v3alpha1</code> resource
     with the same name as a <code>getambassador.io/v2</code> resource or vice versa: only
     one version can be stored at a time.<br/>
     <br/>
     If you find that your $productName$ $versionTwoX$ installation and your $productName$ 1.14
     installation absolutely must have resources that are only seen by one version or the
     other way, see overview section 2, "If needed, you can use labels to further isolate configurations".
   </Alert>

   **If you find that you need to roll back**, just reinstall your 1.14 CRDs, delete your
   installation of $productName$ $versionTwoX$, and delete the `emissary-system` namespace.

6. **When ready, switch over to $productName$ $versionTwoX$.**

   You can run $productName$ 1.14 and $productName$ $versionTwoX$ side-by-side as long as you care
   to. However, taking full advantage of $productName$ 2.X's capabilities **requires**
   [updating your configuration to use `getambassador.io/v3alpha1` configuration resources](../../../../convert-to-v3alpha1),
   since some useful features in $productName$ $versionTwoX$ are only available using
   `getambassador.io/v3alpha1` resources.

   When you're ready to have $productName$ $versionTwoX$ handle traffic on its own, switch
   your original $productName$ 1.14 Service to point to $productName$ $versionTwoX$. Use
   `kubectl edit service ambassador` and change the `selectors` to:

   ```
   app.kubernetes.io/instance: edge-stack
   app.kubernetes.io/name: edge-stack
   profile: main
   ```

   Repeat using `kubectl edit service ambassador-admin` for the `ambassador-admin`
   Service.

7. **Install the $productName$ $versionTwoX$ Ambassador Agent.**

   First, scale the 1.14 agent to 0:

   ```
   kubectl scale -n ambassador deployment/ambassador-agent --replicas=0
   ```

   Once that's done, install the new Agent. **Note that if you needed to set
   `AMBASSADOR_LABEL_SELECTOR`, you must add that to this `helm upgrade` command.**

   ```bash
   helm upgrade -n ambassador \
        --set emissary-ingress.agent.enabled=true \
        --set rateLimit.create=false \
        --set authService.create=false \
        --set emissary-ingress.env.AES_ACME_LEADER_DISABLE=true \
      $productHelmName$ datawire/$productHelmName$ && \
   kubectl rollout status -n ambassador deployment/edge-stack -w
   ```

8. **Finally, enable ACME in $productName$ $versionTwoX$.**

   First, scale the 1.14 Ambassador to 0:

   ```
   kubectl scale -n ambassador deployment/ambassador --replicas=0
   ```

   Once that's done, enable ACME in $productName$ $versionTwoX$. **Note that if you
   needed to set `AMBASSADOR_LABEL_SELECTOR`, you must add that to this
   `helm upgrade` command.**

   ```bash
   helm upgrade -n ambassador \
        --set emissary-ingress.agent.enabled=true \
        --set rateLimit.create=false \
        --set authService.create=false \
        --set emissary-ingress.env.AES_ACME_LEADER_DISABLE= \
      $productHelmName$ datawire/$productHelmName$ && \
   kubectl rollout status -n ambassador deployment/edge-stack -w
   ````

Congratulations! At this point, $productName$ $versionTwoX$ is fully running, and
it's safe to remove the old `ambassador` and `ambassador-agent` Deployments:

```
kubectl delete -n ambassador deployment/ambassador deployment/ambassador-agent
```

Once $productName$ 1.14 is no longer running, you may [convert](../../../../convert-to-v3alpha1)
any remaining `getambassador.io/v2` resources to `getambassador.io/v3alpha1`.
You may also want to redirect DNS to the `edge-stack` Service and remove the
`ambassador` Service.
