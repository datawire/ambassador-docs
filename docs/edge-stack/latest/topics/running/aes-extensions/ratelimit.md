# Rate limiting extension

The Ambassador Edge Stack ships with a rate limiting service that is enabled
to perform advanced rate limiting out of the box.

Configuration of the `Mapping` and `RateLimit` resources that control **how**
to rate limit requests can be found in the
[Rate Limiting](../../../using/rate-limits) section of the documentation.

This document focuses on how to deploy and manage the rate limiting extension.

## Ambassador configuration

Ambassador uses the [`RateLimitService` plugin](../../services/rate-limit-service)
to connect to the rate limiting extension in the Ambassador Edge Stack.

The default `RateLimitService` is named `ambassador-edge-stack-ratelimit` and is
defined as:

```yaml
apiVersion: getambassador.io/v3alpha1
kind: RateLimitService
metadata:
  name: ambassador-edge-stack-ratelimit
  namespace: ambassador
spec:
  service: 127.0.0.1:8500
```

This configures Envoy to send requests that are labeled for rate limiting to the
extension process running on port 8500. The rate limiting extension will then
use that request to count against any `RateLimit` whose pattern matches the
request labels.

## Authentication extension configuration

Certain use cases may require some tuning of the rate limiting extension.
Configuration of this extension is managed via environment variables.
[The Ambassador Container](../../environment) has a full list of environment
variables available for configuration. This document highlights the ones used
by the rate limiting extension.

#### Redis

The rate limiting extension relies heavily on redis for writing and reading
counters for the different `RateLimit` patterns.

The Ambassador Edge Stack shares the same Redis pool for all features that use
Redis.

See the [Redis documentation](../../aes-redis) for information on Redis tuning.

### REDIS_PERSECOND

If `REDIS_PERSECOND` is true, a second Redis connection pool is created (to a
potentially different Redis instance) that is only used for per-second
RateLimits; this second connection pool is configured by the `REDIS_PERSECOND_*`
variables rather than the usual `REDIS_*` variables.

#### `AES_RATELIMIT_PREVIEW`

Set `AES_RATELIMIT_PREVIEW` to `true` to access support for redis clustering,
local caching, and an upgraded redis client with improved scalability in
preview mode.

#### `LOCAL_CACHE_SIZE_IN_BYTES`

* Only available if `AES_RATELIMIT_PREVIEW: "true`.

The AES rate limit extension can optionally cache over-the-limit keys so it does
not need to read the redis cache again for requests with labels that are already
over the limit.

Setting `LOCAL_CACHE_SIZE_IN_BYTES` to a non-zero value with enable local
caching.

#### `NEAR_LIMIT_RATIO`

* Only available if `AES_RATELIMIT_PREVIEW: "true"`

Adjusts the ratio used by the `near_limit` statistic for tracking requests that
are "near the limit".

Defaults to `0.8` (80%) of the limit defined in the `RateLimit` rule.
