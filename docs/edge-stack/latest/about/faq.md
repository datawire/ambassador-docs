# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### Why $productName$?

Kubernetes shifts application architecture for microservices, as well as the
development workflow for a full-cycle development. $productName$ is designed for
the Kubernetes world with:

* Sophisticated traffic management capabilities (thanks to its use of [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io)), such as load balancing, circuit breakers, rate limits, and automatic retries.
* API management capabilities such as a developer portal and OpenID Connect integration for Single Sign-On.
* A declarative, self-service management model built on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions, enabling GitOps-style continuous delivery workflows.

We've written about [the history of $productName$](https://blog.getambassador.io/building-ambassador-an-open-source-api-gateway-on-kubernetes-and-envoy-ed01ed520844), [Why $productName$ In Depth](../why-ambassador), [Features and Benefits](../features-and-benefits) and about the [evolution of API Gateways](../../topics/concepts/microservices-api-gateways/).

### What's the difference between $OSSproductName$ and $AESproductName$?

$OSSproductName$ is a CNCF Incubating project and provides the open-source core of $AESproductName$. Originally we called $OSSproductName$ the "Ambassador API Gateway", but as the project evolved, we realized that the functionality we were building had extended far beyond an API Gateway. In particular, the $AESproductName$ is intended to provide all the functionality you need at the edge -- hence, an "edge stack." This includes an API Gateway, ingress controller, load balancer, developer portal, and more.

### How is $AESproductName$ licensed?

The core $OSSproductName$ is open source under the Apache Software License 2.0. The GitHub repository for the core is [https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary](https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary). Some additional features of the $AESproductName$ (e.g., Single Sign-On) are not open source and available under a proprietary license.

### Can I use the add-on features for $AESproductName$ for free?

Yes! For more details please see the [$productName$ Licenses page](../../topics/using/licenses).

### How does $productName$ use Envoy Proxy?

$productName$ uses [Envoy Proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io) as its core proxy. Envoy is an open-source, high-performance proxy originally written by Lyft. Envoy is now part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

### Is $productName$ production ready?

Yes. Thousands of organizations, large and small, run $productName$ in production.
Public users include Chick-Fil-A, ADP, Microsoft, NVidia, and AppDirect, among others.

### What is the performance of $productName$?

There are many dimensions to performance. We published a benchmark of [$productName$ performance on Kubernetes](/resources/envoyproxy-performance-on-k8s/). Our internal performance regressions cover many other scenarios; we expect to publish more data in the future.

### What's the difference between a service mesh (such as Istio) and $productName$?

Service meshes focus on routing internal traffic from service to service
("east-west"). $productName$ focuses on traffic into your cluster ("north-south").
While both a service mesh and $productName$ can route L7 traffic, the reality is that
these use cases are quite different. Many users will integrate $productName$ with a
service mesh. Production customers of $productName$ have integrated with Consul,
Istio, and Linkerd2.

## Common Configurations

### How do I disable the 404 landing page?

See the [Controlling the $productName$ 404 Page](../../howtos/controlling-404) how-to.

### How do I disable the default Admin mappings?

See the [Protecting the Diagnostics Interface](../../howtos/protecting-diag-access) how-to.

## Troubleshooting

### How do I get help for $productName$?

We have an online [Slack community](http://a8r.io/slack) with thousands of
users. We try to help out as often as possible, although we can't promise a
particular response time. If you need a guaranteed SLA, we also have commercial
contracts. [Contact sales](/contact-us/) for more information.

### What do I do when I get the error `no healthy upstream`?

This error means that $productName$ could not connect to your backend service.
Start by verifying that your backend service is actually available and
responding by sending an HTTP response directly to the pod. Then, verify that
$productName$ is routing by deploying a test service and seeing if the mapping
works. Then, verify that your load balancer is properly routing requests to
$productName$. In general, verifying each network hop between your client and
backend service is critical to finding the source of the problem.
