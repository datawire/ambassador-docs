# Web Application Firewalls in $productName$

[$productName$][] comes fully equipped with a Web Application Firewall solution (commonly referred to as WAF) that is easy to set up and can be configured to help protect your web applications by preventing and mitigating many common attacks. To accomplish this, the [Coraza Web Application Firewall library][] is used to check incoming requests against a user-defined configuration file containing rules and settings for the firewall to determine whether to allow or deny incoming requests.

$productName$ also has additional authentication features such as [Filters][] and [Rate Limiting][]. When `Filters`, `Ratelimits`, and `WebApplicationFirewalls` are all used at the same time, the order of operations is as follows and is not currently configurable.

1. `WebApplicationFirewalls` are always executed first
2. `Filters` are executed next (so long as any configured `WebApplicationFirewalls` did not already reject the request)
3. Lastly `Ratelimits` are executed (so long as any configured `WebApplicationFirewalls` and Filters did not already reject the request)

## The Web Application Firewalls Resource

In $productName$, the `WebApplicationFirewall` resource defines the configuration for an instance of the firewall.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: gateway.getambassador.io/v1alpha1
kind: WebApplicationFirewall
metadata:
  name: "example-waf"
  namespace: "example-namespace"
spec:
  ambassadorSelector:             # optional; default = {ambassadorIds: ["default"]}
    ambassadorIds: []string       # optional; default = ["default"]
  firewallRules:                  # required; One of configMapRef;file;http must be set below
    sourceType: "enum"            # required; allowed values are file;configmap;http
    configMapRef:                 # optional
      name: "string"              # required
      namespace: "string"         # required
      key: "string"               # required
    file: "string"                # optional
    http:                         # optional
      url: "string"               # required; must be a valid URL.
  logging:                        # optional
    onInterrupt:                  # required
      enabled: bool               # required
status:                           # set and updated by application
  conditions: []metav1.Condition
```

- `ambassadorSelector` Configures how this resource is allowed to be watched/used by instances of Edge Stack
  - `ambassadorIds`: This optional field allows you to limit which instances of $productName$ can watch and use this resource. This allows for the separation of resources when running multiple instances of $productName$ in the same Kubernetes cluster. Additional documentation on [configuring Ambassador IDs can be found here][]. By default, all instances of $productName$ will be able to watch and use this resource.
- `firewallRules`: Defines the rules to be used for the Web Application Firewall
  - `sourceType`: Identifies which method is being used to load the firewall rules. Value must be one of `configMapRef`;`file`;`http`. The value corresponds to the following fields for configuring the selected method.
  - `configMapRef`: Defines a reference to a `ConfigMap` in the Kubernetes cluster to load firewall rules from.
    - `name`: Name of the `ConfigMap`.
    - `namespace`: Namespace of the `ConfigMap`. It must be an RFC 1123 label. Valid values include: `"example"`. Invalid values include: `"example.com"` - `"."` is an invalid character. The maximum allowed length is `63` characters and the regex pattern `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$` is used for validation.
    - `key`: The key in the `ConfigMap` to pull the rules data from.
  - `file`: Location of a file on disk to load the firewall rules from. Example: `"/ambassador/firewall/waf.conf`.
  - `http`: Configuration for downloading firewall rules from the internet. The rules will only be downloaded once when the `WebApplicationFirewall` is loaded. The rules will then be cached in-memory until a restart of $productName$ occurs or the `WebApplicationFirewall` is modified.
  - `url`: URL to fetch firewall rules from. If the rules are unable to be downloaded/parsed from the provided url for whatever reason, the requests matched to this `WebApplicationFirewall` will be allowed/denied based on the configuration of the `onError`
- `logging`: Provides a way to configure additional logging in the $productName$ pods for the `WebApplicationFirewall`. This is in addition to the logging config that is available via the firewall configuration files. The following logs will always be output to the container logs when enabled.
  - `onInterrupt`: Controls logging behavior when the WebApplicationFirewall interrupts a request.
    - `enabled`: Configures whether the container should output logs.

`status`: This field is automatically set to reflect the status of the `WebApplicationFirewall`.

- `conditions`: Conditions describe the current conditions of the `WebApplicationFirewall`, known conditions are `Accepted`;`Ready`;`Rejected`.

## The Web Application Firewalls Policy Resource

The `WebApplicationFirewallPolicy` resource controls which requests to match on and which `WebApplicationFirewall` configuration to use. This gives users total control over the firewall configuration and when it is executed on requests. It is possible to set up multiple different firewall configurations for specific requests or a single firewall configuration that is applied to all requests.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: gateway.getambassador.io/v1alpha1
kind: WebApplicationFirewallPolicy
metadata:
  name: "example-waf-policy"
  namespace: "example-namespace"
spec:
  ambassadorSelector:             # optional; default = {ambassadorIds: ["default"]}
    ambassadorIds: []string       # optional; default = ["default"]
  rules:                          # required
  - host: "string"                # optional; default = * (runs on all hosts)
    path: "string"                # optional; default = * (runs on all paths)
    ifRequestHeader:              # optional
      type: "enum"                # optional; allowed values are Exact;RegularExpression
      name: "string"              # required
      value: "string"             # optional
      negate: bool                # optional; default: false
    wafRef:                       # required
      name: "string"              # required
      namespace: "string"         # required
    onError:                      # optional; min=400, max=599
      statusCode: int             # required
    precedence: int               # optional
status:                           # set and updated by application
  conditions: []metav1.Condition
  ruleStatuses:
  - index: int
    host: "string"
    path: "string"
    conditions: []metav1.Condition
```

`spec`: Defines which requests to match on and which `WebApplicationFirewall` to be used against those requests.

- `ambassadorSelector` Configures how this resource is allowed to be watched/used by instances of Edge Stack
  - `ambassadorIds`: This optional field allows you to limit which instances of $productName$ can watch and use this resource. This allows for the separation of resources when running multiple instances of $productName$ in the same Kubernetes cluster. Additional documentation on [configuring Ambassador IDs can be found here][]. By default, all instances of $productName$ will be able to watch and use this resource.
- `rules`: This object configures matching requests and executes `WebApplicationFirewall`s on them.
  - `host`: Host is a "glob-string" that matches on the `:authority` header of the incoming request. If not set, it will match on all incoming requests.
  - `path`: Path is a "glob-string" that matches on the request path. If not provided, then it will match on all incoming requests.
  - `ifRequestHeader`: Checks if exact or regular expression matches a value in a request header to determine if the `WebApplicationFirewall` is executed or not.
    - `type`: Specifies how to match against the value of the header. Allowed values are `Exact`;`RegularExpression`
    - `name`: Name of the HTTP Header to be matched. Name matching MUST be case-insensitive. (See <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2>)
    - `value`: Value of HTTP Header to be matched. If type is `RegularExpression`, then this must be a valid regex with a length of at least 1.
    - `negate`: Allows the match criteria to be negated or flipped.
  - `wafRef`: A reference to a `WebApplicationFirewall` to be applied against the request.
    - `name`: Identifies the `WebApplicationFirewall`
    - `namespace`: Namespace of the `WebApplicationFirewall`. This field is required. It must be a RFC 1123 label. Valid values include: `"example"`. Invalid values include: `"example.com"` - `"."` is an invalid character. The maximum allowed length is `63` characters, and the regex pattern `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$` is used for validation.
  - `onError`: provides a way to configure how requests are handled when a request matches the rule but there is a configuration or runtime error. By default, requests are allowed on error if this field is not configured. This covers runtime errors such as those caused by networking/request parsing as well as configuration errors such as if the `WebApplicationFirewall` that is referenced is misconfigured, cannot be found, or when its configuration cannot be loaded properly. Details about the errors can be found either in the `WebApplicationFirewall` status or container logs.
    - `statusCode`: The status code to return to downstream clients when an error occurs.
  - `precedence`: Allows forcing a precedence ordering on the rules. By default the rules are evaluated in the order they are in the `WebApplicationFirewallPolicy.spec.rules` field. However, multiple `WebApplicationFirewallPolicys` can be applied to a cluster. `precedence` can optionally be used to ensure that a specific ordering is enforced.

`status`: This field is automatically set to reflect the status of the `WebApplicationFirewallPolicy`.

- `conditions`: Conditions describe the current conditions of the `WebApplicationFirewallPolicy`, known conditions are `Accepted`;`Ready`;`Rejected`. If any rules have an error then the whole `WebApplicationFirewallPolicyPolicy` will be rejected.
- `ruleStatuses`:
  - `index`: Provides the zero-based index in the list of Rules to help identify the rule with an error.
  - `host`: host of the rule with the error
  - `path`: path of the rule with the error
  - `conditions`: Describe the current condition of this Rule. Known values are `Accepted`;`Ready`;`Rejected`. If any rules have an error then the whole `WebApplicationFirewallPolicy` will be rejected.

## Quickstart

1. First, start by creating your firewall configuration. The example will download [the firewall rules][] published by [Ambassador Labs][], but you are free to write your own or use the published rules as a reference.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
   ---
   apiVersion: gateway.getambassador.io/v1alpha1
   kind: WebApplicationFirewall
   metadata:
     name: "example-waf"
     namespace: "default"
   spec:
     firewallRules:
       - sourceType: "http"
         http:
           url: "https://app.getambassador.io/download/waf/v1-20230620/aes-waf.conf"
       - sourceType: "http"
         http:
           url: "https://app.getambassador.io/download/waf/v1-20230620/crs-setup.conf"
       - sourceType: "http"
         http:
           url: "https://app.getambassador.io/download/waf/v1-20230620/waf-rules.conf"
   EOF
   ```

2. Next create a `WebApplicationFirewallPolicy` to control which requests the firewall should run on. The example will run the firewall on all requests, but you can customize the policy to only run for specific requests.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
   ---
   apiVersion: gateway.getambassador.io/v1alpha1
   kind: WebApplicationFirewallPolicy
   metadata:
     name: "example-waf-policy"
     namespace: "default"
   spec:
     rules:
     - wafRef: # This rule will be executed on all paths and hostnames
         name: "example-waf"
         namespace: "default"
   EOF
   ```

3. Finally, send a request that will be blocked by the Web Application Firewall

   ```console
   $ curl https://<HOSTNAME>/test -H 'User-Agent: Arachni/0.2.1'
   ```

Congratulations, you've successfully set up a Web Application Firewall to secure all requests coming into $productName$.

  <Alert severity="info">
  After applying your <code>WebApplicationFirewall</code> and <code>WebApplicationFirewall</code> resources, check their statuses to make sure that they were not rejected due to any configuration errors.
  </Alert>

## Rules for Web Application Firewalls

Since the [Coraza Web Application Firewall library][] $productName$'s Web Application Firewall implementation, the firewall rules configuration uses [Coraza's Seclang syntax][] which is compatible with the OWASP Core Rule Set.

Ambassador Labs publishes and maintains a list of rules to be used with the Web Application Firewall that should be a good solution for most users and [Coraza also provides their own ruleset][] based on the [OWASP][] core rule set. It also
satisifies [PCI 6.6][] compliance requirements.

Ambassador Labs rules differ from the OWASP Core ruleset in the following areas:

- WAF engine is enabled by default.
- A more comprehensive set of rules is enabled, including rules related to compliance with PCI DSS 6.5 and 12.1 requirements.

See [Configuring $productName$'s Web Application Firewall rules][] for more information about installing Ambassador Labs rules.

For specific information about rule configuration, please refer to [Coraza's Seclang documentation][]

## Observability

To make using $productName$'s Web Application Firewall system easier and to enable automated workflows and alerts, there are three main methods of observability for Web Application Firewall behavior.

### Logging

  $productName$ will log information about requests approved and denied by any `WebApplicationFirewalls` along with the reason why the request was denied.
  You can configure the logging policies in the [coraza rules configuration][] where logs are sent to and how much information is logged.
  Ambassador Labs' default ruleset sends the WAF logs to stdout so they show up in the container logs.

### Metrics

  $productName$ also outputs metrics about the Web Application Firewall, including the number of requests approved and denied, and performance information.

| Metric                              | Type                  | Description                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
