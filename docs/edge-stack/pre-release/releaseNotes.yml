    date: '2021-06-18'
    notes:
      - title: Developer Preview!
        body: $productName$ 2.0.0 is a Developer Preview; while we believe that it's stable enough for testing and feedback, some things may change, and it may not be as stable as our usual GA releases. We welcome feedback! Join us on <a href="https://a8r.io/slack">Slack</a> and let us know what you think!

      - title: Configuration API v3alpha1
        body: $productName$ 2.0.0 introduces API version <code>x.getambassador.io/v3alpha1</code> for configuration changes that are not backwards compatible with the 1.X family. API versions <code>getambassador.io/v0</code> and <code>getambassador.io/v1</code> are deprecated. Further details are available in the <a href="about/changes-2.0.0/#1-configuration-api-version-xgetambassadoriov3alpha1">2.0.0 Changes</a> document.

      - title: The AmbassadorListener Resource
        body: The new <code>AmbassadorListener</code> CRD defines where and how to listen for requests from the network, and which <code>AmbassadorHost</code> definitions should be used to process those requests. Note that the <code>AmbassadorListener</code> CRD consolidates <i>all</i> port configuration; see the <a href="topics/running/ambassadorlistener"><code>AmbassadorListener</code> documentation</a> for more details.

        image: ./edge-stack-2.0.0-listener.png

      - title: Port configuration outside AmbassadorListener has been moved to AmbassadorListener
        body: The <code>TLSContext</code> <code>redirect_cleartext_from</code> and <code>AmbassadorHost</code> <code>requestPolicy.insecure.additionalPort</code> elements are no longer supported. Use a <code>AmbassadorListener</code> for this functionality instead.
        type: change
        docs: about/changes-2.0.0/#tlscontext-redirect_cleartext_from-and-host-insecureadditionalport

      - title: PROXY protocol configuration has been moved to AmbassadorListener
        body: The <code>use_proxy_protocol</code> element of the Ambassador <code>Module</code> is no longer supported, as it is now part of the <code>AmbassadorListener</code> resource (and can be set per-<code>AmbassadorListener</code> rather than globally).
        type: change
        docs: about/changes-2.0.0/#proxy-protocol-configuration

      - title: Independent Host actions supported
        body: Each <code>AmbassadorHost</code> can specify its <code>requestPolicy.insecure.action</code> independently of any other <code>AmbassadorHost</code>, allowing for HTTP routing as flexible as HTTPS routing.
        docs: topics/running/host-crd/#secure-and-insecure-requests
        image: ./edge-stack-2.0.0-insecure_action_hosts.png
        type: bugfix

      - title: Stricter rules for AmbassadorHost/AmbassadorMapping association
        body: A <code>AmbassadorMapping</code> will only be matched with a <code>AmbassadorHost</code> if the <code>AmbassadorMapping</code>'s <code>host</code> or the <code>AmbassadorHost</code>'s <code>selector</code> (or both) are explicitly set, and match. This change can significantly improve $productName$'s memory footprint when many <code>AmbassadorHost</code>s are involved. Further details are available in the <a href="about/changes-2.0.0/#host-and-mapping-association">2.0.0 Changes</a> document.

        type: change

      - title: AmbassadorHost or Ingress now required for TLS termination
        body: A <code>AmbassadorHost</code> or <code>Ingress</code> resource is now required when terminating TLS -- simply creating a <code>TLSContext</code> is not sufficient. Further details are available in the <a href="about/changes-2.0.0/#host-tlscontext-and-tls-termination"><code>AmbassadorHost</code> CRD documentation.</a>

      - title: Envoy V3 APIs
        body: By default, $productName$ will configure Envoy using the V3 Envoy API. This change is mostly transparent to users, but note that Envoy V3 does not support unsafe regular expressions or e.g. Zipkin's V1 collector protocol. Further details are available in the <a href="about/changes-2.0.0">2.0.0 Changes</a> document.

      - title: Correctly set Ingress resource status in all cases
        body: $productName$ 2.0.0 fixes a regression in detecting the Ambassador Kubernetes service that could cause the wrong IP or hostname to be used in Ingress statuses -- thanks, [Noah Fontes](https://github.com/impl)!
        docs: topics/running/ingress-controller
        type: bugfix
        image: ./edge-stack-2.0.0-ingressstatus.png

      - title: Module-based TLS no longer supported
        body: The <code>tls</code> module and the <code>tls</code> field in the Ambassador module are no longer supported. Please use <code>TLSContext</code> resources instead.

        image: ./edge-stack-2.0.0-tlscontext.png
        type: change

      - title: Memory usage improvements for installations with many AmbassadorHosts
        body: The behavior of the Ambassador module <code>prune_unreachable_routes</code> field is now automatic, which should reduce Envoy memory requirements for installations with many <code>AmbassadorHost</code>s
        docs: topics/running/ambassador/#prune-unreachable-routes
        image: ./edge-stack-2.0.0-prune_routes.png
        type: feature

      - title: Higher performance while generating envoy configuration now enabled by default
        body: The environment variable <code>AMBASSADOR_FAST_RECONFIGURE</code> is now set by default, enabling the higher-performance implementation of the code that $productName$ uses to generate and validate Envoy configurations.
        docs: topics/running/scaling/#ambassador_fast_reconfigure-and-ambassador_legacy_mode-flags
        type: change

      # This set of release notes is for Edge Stack. edgectl is still a thing for Edge Stack (in the form of edgectl license).
      - title: edgectl install no longer supported
        body: The <code>edgectl install</code> command has been removed. Please use the <code>edge-stack</code> Helm chart to install $productName$ instead.
        type: change
        docs: topics/install/helm/

      - title: Service Preview no longer supported
        body: Service Preview is no longer supported in $productName$, and has been removed. Please use <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/telepresence">Telepresence</a> instead.
        docs: https://www.getambassador.io/docs/telepresence
        type: change

        body: The Edge Policy Console has been removed as part of the move to Ambassador Cloud. If needed, you can also access the diagnostics UI.
        type: change
        docs: https://app.getambassador.io/

      - title: Project CRD removed
        body: We have removed support for the <code>Project</code> CRD in $productName$, in favor of ArgoCD.

  - version: 1.13.8
    date: '2021-06-08'
    notes:
      - title: Fix Ambassador Cloud Service Details
        body: "Fixed a bug that occasionally caused missing version information for a service in the Ambassador Service Catalog, especially in clusters with high pod churn."
        type: bugfix
        docs: tutorials/getting-started/#3-connect-your-cluster-to-ambassador-cloud
        image: ./edge-stack-1.13.8-cloud-bugfix.png
      - title: Improved Argo Rollouts Experience with Ambassador Cloud
        body: "Ambassador Agent now reports the state of ArgoCD configurations and Deployments in order to provide proper configurations to the users while setting up the Argo Rollouts feature."

  - version: 1.13.7
    date: '2021-06-03'
    notes:
      - title: JSON logging support
        body: "An <code>AMBASSADOR_JSON_LOGGING</code> environment variable has been added. When set to <code>true</code> JSON format will be used for most of the control plane logs. Some (but few) logs from <code>gunicorn</code> and the Kubernetes <code>client-go</code> package will still be in text only format."

        type: feature
      - title: Consul resolver bugfix with TCPMappings
        body: "The TCPMapping has the ability to specify a resolver, however the <code>ConsulResolver</code> did not work properly with it. It now utilizes the Consul Connect service discovery instead of falling back to attempting to register an arbitrary endpoint."
        image: ./edge-stack-1.13.7-tcpmapping-consul.png
        docs: topics/running/resolvers/#the-consul-resolver
        type: bugfix
      - title: Memory usage calculation improvements
        body: "The internal memory usage calculation that $productName$ performs has been updated to exclude cache memory. This now matches how the kernel OOMKiller calculates memory and should avoid situations where Envoy updates are throttled unnecessarily."

    notes:
      - title: Envoy 1.15.5
        body: $productName$ bas been updated to Envoy 1.15.5, which addresses a high severity security vulnerability (CVE-2021-29492). $productName$ can now be configured to reject client requests that contain escaped slashes.
