# This file should be placed in the folder for the version of the
# product that's meant to be documented. A `/release-notes` page will
# be automatically generated and populated at build time.
#
# Note that an entry needs to be added to the `doc-links.yml` file in
# order to surface the release notes in the table of contents.
#
# The YAML in this file should contain:
#
# changelog: An (optional) URL to the CHANGELOG for the product.
# items: An array of releases with the following attributes:
#     - version: The (optional) version number of the release, if applicable.
#     - date: The date of the release in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
#     - notes: An array of noteworthy changes included in the release, each having the following attributes:
#         - type: The type of change, one of `bugfix`, `feature`, `security` or `change`.
#         - title: A short title of the noteworthy change.
#         - body: >-
#             Two or three sentences describing the change and why it
#             is noteworthy.  This is HTML, not plain text or
#             markdown.  It is handy to use YAML's ">-" feature to
#             allow line-wrapping.
#         - image: >-
#             The URL of an image that visually represents the
#             noteworthy change.  This path is relative to the
#             `release-notes` directory; if this file is
#             `FOO/releaseNotes.yml`, then the image paths are
#             relative to `FOO/release-notes/`.
#         - docs: The path to the documentation page where additional information can be found.
#         - href: A path from the root to a resource on the getambassador website, takes precedence over a docs link.

  - version: 1.13.10
    date: '2021-07-27'
    notes:
      - title: Fix for CORS origins configuration on the Mapping resource
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          Fixed a regression when specifying a comma separated string for <code>cors.origins</code>
          on the <code>Mapping</code> resource.
          ([#3609](https://github.com/emissary-ingress/emissary/issues/3609))

      - title: New Envoy-configuration snapshots for debugging
        body: "Envoy-configuration snapshots get saved (as <code>ambex-#.json</code>) in <code>/ambassador/snapshots</code>. The number of snapshots is controlled by the <code>AMBASSADOR_AMBEX_SNAPSHOT_COUNT</code> environment variable; set it to 0 to disable. The default is 30."
        type: change
        docs: topics/running/environment/

      - title: Optionally remove ratelimiting for Envoy reconfiguration
        body: >-
          Set <code>AMBASSADOR_AMBEX_NO_RATELIMIT</code> to <code>true</code> to completely disable
          ratelimiting Envoy reconfiguration under memory pressure. This can help performance with
          the endpoint or Consul resolvers, but could make OOMkills more likely with large
          configurations. The default is <code>false</code>, meaning that the rate limiter is
          active.

        docs: topics/running/environment/

      - title: Mappings support configuring the DevPortal fetch timeout
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          The <code>Mapping</code> resource can now specify <code>docs.timeout_ms</code> to set the
          timeout when the Dev Portal is fetching API specifications.

        image: ../images/edge-stack-1.13.10-docs-timeout.png

      - title: Dev Portal will strip HTML tags when displaying results
        type: bugfix
        body: >-
          The Dev Portal will now strip HTML tags when displaying search results, showing just the
          actual content of the search result.
        docs: topics/using/dev-portal

      - title: Consul certificate rotation logs more information
        type: change
        body: >-
          Consul certificate-rotation logging now includes the fingerprints and validity timestamps
          of certificates being rotated.

  - version: 1.13.9
    date: '2021-06-30'
    notes:
      - title: Fix for TCPMappings
        body: "Fixed a bug which caused $productName$ to generate invalid Envoy configuration when two TCPMappings were configured with the same port, but different hosts."
        type: bugfix
        docs: topics/using/tcpmappings/
  - version: 1.13.8
    date: '2021-06-08'
    notes:
      - title: Fix Ambassador Cloud Service Details
        body: "Fixed a bug that occasionally caused missing version information for a service in the Ambassador Service Catalog, especially in clusters with high pod churn."
        type: bugfix
        docs: tutorials/getting-started/#3-connect-your-cluster-to-ambassador-cloud
        image: ../images/edge-stack-1.13.8-cloud-bugfix.png
      - title: Improved Argo Rollouts Experience with Ambassador Cloud
        body: "Ambassador Agent now reports the state of ArgoCD configurations and Deployments in order to provide proper configurations to the users while setting up the Argo Rollouts feature."
        type: feature
        docs: https://www.getambassador.io/docs/argo

  - version: 1.13.7
    date: '2021-06-03'
    notes:
      - title: JSON logging support
        body: "An <code>AMBASSADOR_JSON_LOGGING</code> environment variable has been added. When set to <code>true</code> JSON format will be used for most of the control plane logs. Some (but few) logs from <code>gunicorn</code> and the Kubernetes <code>client-go</code> package will still be in text only format."
        image: ../images/edge-stack-1.13.7-json-logging.png
        docs: topics/running/running/#log-format
        type: feature
      - title: Consul resolver bugfix with TCPMappings
        body: "The TCPMapping has the ability to specify a resolver, however the <code>ConsulResolver</code> did not work properly with it. It now utilizes the Consul Connect service discovery instead of falling back to attempting to register an arbitrary endpoint."
        image: ../images/edge-stack-1.13.7-tcpmapping-consul.png
        docs: topics/running/resolvers/#the-consul-resolver
        type: bugfix
      - title: Memory usage calculation improvements
        body: "The internal memory usage calculation that $productName$ performs has been updated to exclude cache memory. This now matches how the kernel OOMKiller calculates memory and should avoid situations where Envoy updates are throttled unnecessarily."

        docs: topics/running/scaling/#inspecting-ambassador-performance
        type: change

    date: '2021-05-13'
    notes:
      - title: Envoy 1.15.5
        body: $productName$ has been updated to Envoy 1.15.5, which addresses a high severity security vulnerability (CVE-2021-29492). $productName$ can now be configured to reject client requests that contain escaped slashes.
