# Service Preview

How do you verify that the code you've written actually works? Ambassador Pro's *Service Preview* lets developers see exactly how their service works in a realistic enviroment -- without impacting other developers or end users. Service Preview integrates [Telepresence](https://www.telepresence.io), the popular CNCF project for local development and debugging on Kubernetes.

## Install `apictl`

`apictl` is the command client for Ambassador Pro.

Download the latest version of the client:

<a class="apictl-dl" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/datawire-static-files/apictl/$aproVersion$/darwin/amd64/apictl">Mac 64-bit</a> |
<a class="apictl-linux-dl" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/datawire-static-files/apictl/$aproVersion$/linux/amd64/apictl">Linux 64-bit</a>

Make sure the client is somewhere on your PATH. In addition, place your license key in `~/.ambassador.key`.

Information about open source code used in `apictl` can be found by running `apictl --version`.

## Getting started

In this quick start, we're going to preview a change we make to the backend service of the tour application, without impacting normal users of the application. Before getting started, make sure the [tour application is installed](../../../user-guide/getting-started#3-creating-your-first-service) on your cluster and you've installed the `apictl` command line tool, as explained above.

1. We're first going to get the tour backend service running locally. Clone the tour repository and build a local image.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/datawire/tour
    cd tour
    make docker.run
    ```

    Note that Preview doesn't depend on a locally running container; you can just run a service locally on your laptop. We're using a container in this tutorial to minimize environmental issues with different golang environments.

    In the `make` command above, we build the backend application in a docker container named `localhost:31000/tour:backend-latest` and run it on port 8080.

2. Now, in another terminal window, redeploy the tour application with the Preview sidecar. The sidecar is special process which will route requests to your local machine or to the production cluster. The `apictl traffic inject` command will automatically create the appropriate YAML to inject the sidecar. In the `tour` directory, pass the file name of the QOTM deployment:

   ```
   apictl traffic inject k8s/tour.yaml -d tour -s tour -p 8080 > k8s/tour-traffic-sidecar.yaml
   ```

   This will create a YAML file called `qotm-sidecar.yaml`. The file will look like the following:

   ```yaml

            name: tour-ui
            ports:
            - containerPort: 5000
              name: http
          - image: quay.io/datawire/tour:backend-$tourVersion$
            name: quote
            ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: http
            resources:
              limits:
                cpu: "0.1"
                memory: 100Mi
          - env:
            - name: APPNAME
              value: tour
            - name: APPPORT
              value: "8080"
            - name: AMBASSADOR_LICENSE_KEY
              value: eJcbGciOiaIUzI1NiIsInR5cCkpXVCJ9.eCI6Im5rcmF1c2UiLCJleHAiOjE1Nzg0MTg4ODZ9.S_6-zdPyy4z1N4Jmo5e4A7fME4CbQVL_13ikw
            image: quay.io/datawire/ambassador_pro:app-sidecar-$aproVersion$
            name: traffic-sidecar
            ports:
            - containerPort: 9900
   ```

   If you examine this file, you will notice a couple of important difference:
   - The `traffic-sidecar` container has been added to the deployment
   - In the service, `targetPort` for the `backend` port mapping has been changed to point to port 9900 which is the port the `traffic-sidecar` container is listening on

4. Redeploy tour with the sidecar:

   ```
   kubectl apply -f k8s/tour-traffic-sidecar.yaml
   ```

5. Test to make sure that both your production and development instances of QOTM work:

    ```
    curl $AMBASSADOR_IP/backend/ # test production
    curl localhost:8080/         # test development
    ```

6. Initialize the traffic manager for the cluster.

    ```
    apictl traffic initialize
    ```

7. We need to create an `intercept` rule that tells Ambassador where to route specific requests. The following command will tell Ambassador to route any traffic for the `tour` deployment where the header `x-service-preview` is `dev` to go to port 8080 on localhost:

    ```
    apictl traffic intercept tour -n x-service-preview -m dev -t 8080
    ```

8. Requests with the header `x-service-preview: dev` will now get routed locally:

    ```
    curl -H "x-service-preview: dev" $AMBASSADOR_IP/backend/` # will go to local Docker instance
    curl $AMBASSADOR_IP/backend/                              # will go to production instance
    ```

9. Make a change to the backend source code. In `backend/main.go`, uncomment out line 85, and comment out line 84, so it reads like so:

    ```golang
    ...
    //quote := s.random.RandomSelectionFromStringSlice(s.quotes)
    quote := "Service Preview Rocks!"
    ...
    ```

    This will insure that the backend service will return a quote of "Service Preview rocks" every time.

10. Rebuild the docker container and rerun  the `curl` above, which will now route to your (modified) local copy of the QOTM service:

    ```
    make docker.run -C backend/
    curl -H "x-service-preview: dev" $AMBASSADOR_IP/qotm/` # will go to local Docker instance
    ```

    To recap: With Preview, we can now see test and visualize changes to our service that we've mode locally, without impacting other users of the stable version of that service.

## Using Service Preview

Service Preview will match HTTP headers based on the headers that are seen by the *sidecar*, and not the edge gateway. Matches are made on the whole header, e.g., a match rule of `dev` will not match in the example above, while `/backend/dev` will match.

While any HTTP header will match, in practice, using host-based routing (i.e., the `:authority` header), a custom HTTP header (e.g., the `x-service-preview` header used above), or an authentication header is recommended.
