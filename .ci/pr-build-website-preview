# Don't trust $TRAVIS_COMMIT, use $(git rev-parse HEAD) instead.
#
# For PRs, it's often set to a stale merge commit that isn't fetched,
# instead of the actual commit pointed to by refs/pull/NNN/merge which
# is checked out.  For example, on
# <https://travis-ci.org/datawire/ambassador-docs/builds/629117603>,
# the webui says         it's testing commit cb8dc0029465119ada1ee9222539c825f5a7c015,
# and TRAVIS_COMMIT says it's testing commit cb8dc0029465119ada1ee9222539c825f5a7c015,
# but in fact            it's testing commit d23659347cd125267b079f2f7900c3e1b032ea4b.
